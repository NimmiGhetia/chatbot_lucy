Modi, a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi.\nBorn to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child, and later ran his own stall. He was introduced to the right-wing Hindu nationalist organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. He left home after graduating from school, partly because of an arranged marriage which he rejected. Modi traveled around India for two years, and visited a number of religious centres. He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad in 1969 or 1970. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.\nModi was appointed chief minister of Gujarat in 2001, due to Keshubhai Patels failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj.

Modi himself was elected to parliament from Varanasi. Since taking office, Modis administration has encouraged foreign direct investment in the Indian economy, increased spending on infrastructure, and reduced spending on health and social welfare programs. Modi has encouraged efficiency in the bureaucracy, and centralised power through the abolition of the planning commission. He has begun a high-profile sanitation campaign, and loosened environmental and labour laws.

Modi, a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi.\nBorn to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child, and later ran his own stall. He was introduced to the right-wing Hindu nationalist organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. He left home after graduating from school, partly because of an arranged marriage which he rejected. Modi traveled around India for two years, and visited a number of religious centres. He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad in 1969 or 1970. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.\nModi was appointed chief minister of Gujarat in 2001, due to Keshubhai Patels failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after.

Modi himself was elected to parliament from Varanasi. Since taking office, Modis administration has encouraged foreign direct investment in the Indian economy, increased spending on infrastructure, and reduced spending on health and social welfare programs. Modi has encouraged efficiency in the bureaucracy, and centralised power through the abolition of the planning commission. He has begun a high-profile sanitation campaign, and loosened environmental and labour laws. A Hindu nationalist and member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Modi remains a controversial figure domestically and internationally.(ref: Buncombe)A rebirth dogged by controversy Everyday Nationalism: Women of the Hindu Right in India Perspectives on Modern South Asia: A Reader in Culture, History, and RepresentationIndian PM Narendra Modi still mired in controversy, says expertEdgy Indian state election going down to the wire Indias Voters Torn Over Politician Gujarat leader Narendra Modi grilled for 10&nbsp;hours at massacre inquiry \n Early life and education \nNarendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat).

It is about the Incarnation of the One who became like us in all things but sin (Heb. 4:15) and who humbled Himself \"to the point of death-even death on a cross\" (Phil. 2:8). Christmas is a pinnacle feast, yes, but it is not the beginning of the liturgical year. It is a memorial, a remembrance, of the birth of Jesus, not really a celebration of the day itself. We remember that because the Jesus of history was born, the Resurrection of the Christ of faith could happen. \" data-accessdate =\" April 2, 2009\" data- isbn =\" 978-1-4185-8073-5\" data- date =\" November 3, 2009\">(ref: Voice-Christmas)Bethlehem, when the sheep are kept inside and not on pasture as told in the Bible.

Modi, a  member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is a Hindu nationalist and member of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).\nBorn to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child, and later ran his own stall. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. He left home after graduating from school, partly because of an arranged marriage which he rejected. Modi traveled around India for two years, and visited a number of religious centres. He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad in 1969 or 1970. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding.

He grew up mostly in Hawaii, but also spent one year of his childhood in Washington State and four years in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988 Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduation, he became a civil rights attorney and professor, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004, with his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after his campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain, and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\nDuring his first two years in office, Obama signed more landmark legislation than any Democratic president since LBJs Great Society. Main reforms were the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often referred to as \"Obamacare\"), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Dont Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession, but the GOP regained control of the House of Representatives in 2011. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, Obama increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the U.S.-Russian New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi, and the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.\nAfter winning re-election over Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted greater inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama also advocated gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated the sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba.\nObama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.Obama leaving office at 60% approval ratingObama approval hits 60% as end of term approaches He currently resides in Washington, D.C.

Credited with engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.[Sources discussing the controversy surrounding Modi.(ref: Buncombe)A rebirth dogged by controversy Everyday Nationalism: Women of the Hindu Right in India Perspectives on Modern South Asia: A Reader in Culture, History, and Representation(ref: Stepan)(ref: Ganguly 2014)(ref: CBC)Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\" data-date=\"16 April 2015\" data-accessdate=\"17 February 2017\" data-url=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/indian-pm-narendra-modi-still-mired-in-controversy-says-expert-1.3036836\">Indian PM Narendra Modi still mired in controversy, says expertReuters \" data-date=\"12 December 2007 \" data-accessdate=\"10 October 2012\">Edgy Indian state election going down to the wire (ref: Robinson)Time Magazine \" data-date=\"11 December 2007 \" data-accessdate=\"10 October 2012\">Indias Voters Torn Over Politician (ref: Burke)The Guardian \" data-date=\"28 March 2010 \" data-accessdate=\"10 October 2012\">Gujarat leader Narendra Modi grilled for 10&nbsp;hours at massacre inquiry ]"}],"timestamp":"2017-04-08T03:38:33.612Z"}

He grew up mostly in Hawaii, but also spent one year of his childhood in Washington State and four years in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988 Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduation, he became a civil rights attorney and professor, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004, with his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after his campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain, and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\nDuring his first two years in office, Obama signed many landmark bills. Main reforms were the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often referred to as \"Obamacare\"), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Dont Ask, Dont Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession, but the GOP regained control of the House of Representatives in 2011. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, Obama increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the U.S.-Russian New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi, and the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.\nAfter winning re-election over Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted greater inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama also advocated gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated the sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba.\nObama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.Obama leaving office at 60% approval ratingObama approval hits 60% as end of term approaches He currently resides in Washington, D.C.

He grew up mostly in Hawaii, but also spent one year of his childhood in Washington State and four years in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988 Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduation, he became a civil rights attorney and professor, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004, with his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after his campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain, and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\nDuring his first two years in office, Obama signed many landmark bills. Main reforms were the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often referred to as \"Obamacare\"), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Dont Ask, Dont Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession, but the GOP regained control of the House of Representatives in 2011. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, Obama increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the U.S.-Russian New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi, and the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.\nAfter winning re-election over Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted greater inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama also advocated gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated the sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba.\nObama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.Obama leaving office at 60% approval ratingObama approval hits 60% as end of term approaches He currently resides in Washington, D.C.

He grew up mostly in Hawaii, but also spent one year of his childhood in Washington State and four years in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988 Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduation, he became a civil rights attorney and professor, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004, with his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after his campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain, and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\nDuring his first two years in office, Obama signed many landmark bills. Main reforms were the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often referred to as \"Obamacare\"), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Dont Ask, Dont Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession, but the GOP regained control of the House of Representatives in 2011. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, Obama increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the U.S.-Russian New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi, and the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.\nAfter winning re-election over Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted greater inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama also advocated gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated the sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba.\nObama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.Obama leaving office at 60% approval ratingObama approval hits 60% as end of term approaches He currently resides in Washington, D.C.

He grew up mostly in Hawaii, but also spent one year of his childhood in Washington State and four years in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988 Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduation, he became a civil rights attorney and professor, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004, with his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after his campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain, and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\nDuring his first two years in office, Obama signed many landmark bills. Main reforms were the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often referred to as \"Obamacare\"), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Dont Ask, Dont Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession, but the GOP regained control of the House of Representatives in 2011. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, Obama increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the U.S.-Russian New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi, and the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.\nAfter winning re-election over Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted greater inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama also advocated gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated the sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba.\nObama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.Obama leaving office at 60% approval ratingObama approval hits 60% as end of term approaches He currently resides in Washington, D.C. His presidential library will be built in Chicago.","output":"Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, two years after the territory was admitted to the Union as the 50th state.

Main reforms were the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often referred to as \"Obamacare\"), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Dont Ask, Dont Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession, but the GOP regained control of the House of Representatives in 2011. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, Obama increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the U.S.-Russian New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi, and the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.\nAfter winning re-election over Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted greater inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama also advocated gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated the sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba.\nObama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.Obama leaving office at 60% approval ratingObama approval hits 60% as end of term approaches He currently resides in Washington, D.C.

It quickly escalated into something more sinister. Soon a pig's head was buried in the ground at the future Nangang mosque, the culmination of a rally in which dozens of residents hoisted banners and circled the planned building site. Then the mosque's imam received a text message carrying a death threat: \"In case someone in your family dies, I have a coffin for you — and more than one, if necessary.\" \"How did things get stirred up to this point?\" the imam, Tao Yingsheng, said in a recent interview. \"Who had even heard of the Nangang mosque before?\" On the dusty plains of the Chinese heartland, a bitter fight over a mosque exemplifies how a surge in anti-Muslim sentiment online is spreading into communities across China, exacerbating simmering ethnic and religious tensions that have in the past erupted in bloodshed. It's also posing a dilemma for the ruling Communist Party, which has allowed Islamophobia to fester online for years as part of its campaign to justify security crackdowns in its restive region of Xinjiang. \"It's let the genie out of the bottle,\" said James Leibold, a professor at La Trobe University in Australia who has tracked the growth of anti-Muslim hate speech on China's internet. Interviews with residents and an examination of social media show how a few disparate online complaints by local homeowners evolved into a concerted campaign to spread hate. Key to it was an unexpected yet influential backer: a Chinese propaganda official, 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles) away in Xinjiang, whose inflammatory social media posts helped draw people into the streets on New Year's Day, resulting in a police crackdown. ___ A stone inscription outside its gate shows the original Nangang mosque was established in the 1780s by members of the Hui minority, the descendants of Silk Road traders who settled across China centuries ago. In its present form, the mosque has served the area's 4,500 Hui for decades, its domed silhouette partially hidden by overgrown shrubs in the countryside beyond Hefei's last paved boulevards. Over the past 10 years urbanization has come to Hefei, with sprawling development reconfiguring the landscape and its demographic flavor, and Hui leaders had been pushing for years to relocate their mosque to a more convenient urban location. City planners in November finally selected a site adjacent to the newly built Hangkong New City condominiums, with its $200,000 two-bedroom units, faux-Mediterranean stylings and a Volvo dealership across the street. The project's homeowners overwhelmingly members of China's ethnic Han majority began complaining on China's popular microblog, Weibo. Some complained the mosque would occupy space promised for a park. Others warned that safety in the area would be compromised. Others were more blunt: Han residents were uncomfortable that a center for Hui community life would be less than 100 meters (300 feet) from their building, a homeowner who later identified himself in messages to the AP by his surname, Cheng, wrote in a petition posted in December. \"And the less said about what happens on Eid al-Adha, the better,\" Cheng wrote, referring to the Islamic holiday in which animals are slaughtered for a sacrificial feast. \"It's absolutely shocking.\" The story soon caught the attention of Cui Zijian, a boyish-looking propaganda official in Xinjiang who writes about the threat of religious extremism on his Weibo account with nearly 30,000 followers. On Dec. 16, Cui suggested homeowners lobby local officials to block the construction, adding: \"If that doesn't work, then how about pig head, pig blood.\" Cui followed that a few hours later with another post repeating the four Chinese characters for pig blood and pig head over and over, attracting hundreds of reposts. While Cui was criticized by some on Weibo, a larger number — including at least one other government propaganda official — took his post as their cue to hurl abuse at the Hui. ___ The mosque dispute was just the latest flashpoint for an increasingly active anti-Muslim social media movement in China. A video of a Hui girl reciting the Quran in Arabic sparked outrage last May over so-called terrorist infiltration of Chinese schools, prompting officials to announce a \"strict ban\" on religion on campuses. Online activists derailed a Hui official's effort to regulate the halal food industry, arguing that religion was creeping into the officially atheistic Chinese state. Han Chinese, who make up 95 percent of the population, have long grumbled about the dozens of China's officially recognized minority groups receiving advantages on the hyper-competitive college entrance exams or exemptions from family-size limits, but online abuse has increasingly targeted Muslims. The rise in Islamophobia comes as Chinese have been buffeted by news of militant attacks in Europe, while at home, violence in Xinjiang and elsewhere has been blamed on Muslim separatists. Beijing has responded to the bloody, years-long insurgency from Muslim Uighur minorities in Xinjiang with further restrictions on Islamic expression, a move rights groups warn could potentially radicalize moderate Muslims. Such policies have also drawn vows of retaliation from the Islamic State and al-Qaeda. Ethnic hostility can only deepen, scholars say, when the government stops discussion of the plight of Muslims or ethnic policies while allowing anti-Muslim rhetoric and hate speech to go unchecked. In 2014, Uighur scholar Ilham Tohti, who had founded a website to host debates about ethnic tensions in Xinjiang, was sentenced to life in prison on separatism charges. Government censors go after descriptions of abuses against Muslims, but \"it doesn't take long whatsoever to find incredibly Islamophobic things that seem to be not censored at all,\" said William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International, which has appealed for Tohti's release. Political observers say the recent rise of a faction within the Communist Party advocating for a hard-line approach on religious affairs has coincided with the rise of government-linked commentators who openly warn about the danger of Islam. \"Interest groups have actively promoted Islamophobia in interior regions in order to create a nationwide environment that justifies Xinjiang's anti-terrorism campaign,\" said Ma Haiyun, a history professor specializing in China's Muslims at Frostburg State University in Maryland. \"There's an Islamophobic movement that aims at creating chaos and even conflicts at the local level.\" After briefly moderating his remarks about the Nangang mosque, the propaganda official, Cui, renewed his criticism in February with an essay arguing that his professional and patriotic duty was to resist extremism. His online speech about Muslims was part of the job, he said. \"For that, we're labeled Muslim-smearers,\" wrote Cui, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment. \"But it is those who instigate a fear of Islam, precisely the terrorists and the extremists, who are the ones smearing Muslims.\" Reached in March, an official at the propaganda department where he worked refused to comment on Cui's involvement in the controversy. But Cui now appears to be even better positioned to influence discourse: The official said Cui was transferred in February to work in the cyberspace administration, the agency in charge of censoring online speech. ___ Tao, the 50-year old imam, recalled the day in December when he heard his mosque was suddenly the subject of thousands of posts and hundreds of comments on Weibo, a service he barely used. He soon found himself soothing local Hui who approached him, shaken by what they were seeing online. \"They said people were planning to hang a pig's head outside our mosque. I said, 'Then we'll remove it.' They said people will bury a pig's head in the ground. I said 'Why can't we just dig it up?'\" Tao said. After protesters followed through with the threat at the New Year's Day demonstration, police detained two protest leaders for two weeks and summoned others for questioning, according to residents. Since then Han indignation has gave way to quiet seething. \"People have been scared into silence,\" said Cheng, the Han tea seller. During a recent visit to Hangkong New City, homeowners repeated the government's mantra that ethnic unity was important, but complained that officials sacrificed their interests to appease a minority. \"If 99 percent of our compound is Han, it doesn't seem appropriate that they put a mosque next door,\" said a middle-aged woman who said her surname was Han. Ma Jianhua, a Nangang district planning official, told the AP that construction will proceed after his office \"appropriately handled\" homeowners' petitions, but declined to elaborate. The mosque dispute has left the city's Hui community on the defensive, with many eager to emphasize their desire to peacefully coexist with their Han neighbors as well as their confidence in the government's handling of the situation. At a ranch past the undulating rapeseed field that separates the condos from rubble-strewn Huimin Lu — Hui People's Road — workers at what is one of the few Hui businesses that hasn't been demolished to make way for high-rises expressed surprise about the mosque dispute, given the area's history of ethnic mingling. \"We've been in these parts a long time,\" a worker surnamed Tao, who is not related to the imam, said as he loaded sacks of dried fatty beef. \"We mind our business and they mind theirs. We don't stir up trouble and they don't either.\" But Tao, the imam, seemed to acknowledge a hardening of attitudes toward Muslims in recent years. \"It may be that the situation has grown more sensitive in that place that we all know about,\" he said after a pause, referring to but not daring to mention Xinjiang. Still he tries to not harbor resentment toward the Han protesters. \"I don't blame the locals because I believe they were influenced,\" he said, sitting below framed pictures of him greeting government religious affairs officials. \"I want them to know Muslims are virtuous people. We are peaceful. We are reasonable. We are tolerant. And we are good Chinese.\"\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/e3711d789c8d48589b77f6e269d424fa/unfettered-online-hate-speech-fuels-islamophobia-china\n\n\n\nTitle:\nTrump advisers: US seeks to fight IS and oust Syria&#039;s Assad\nDescription:\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's national security adviser on Sunday left open the possibility of additional U.S. military action against Syria following last week's missile strike but indicated that the United States was not seeking to act unilaterally to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad. In his first televised interview, H.R. McMaster pointed to dual U.S. goals of defeating the Islamic State group and removing Assad. But he suggested that Trump was seeking a global political response for regime change from U.S. allies as well as Russia, which he said needed to re-evaluate its support of Syria. \"It's very difficult to understand how a political solution could result from the continuation of the Assad regime,\" McMaster said. \"Now, we are not saying that we are the ones who are going to effect that change. What we are saying is, other countries have to ask themselves some hard questions. Russia should ask themselves ...Why are we supporting this murderous regime that is committing mass murder of its own population?\" After last Tuesday's chemical attack in Syria, Trump said his attitude toward Assad \"has changed very much\" and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said \"steps are underway\" to organize a coalition to remove him from power. But as lawmakers called on Trump to consult with Congress on any future military strikes and a longer-term strategy on Syria, Trump administration officials sent mixed signals on the scope of U.S. involvement. While Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, described regime change in Syria as a U.S. priority and inevitable, Tillerson suggested that last week's American airstrikes in retaliation for the chemical attack hadn't really changed U.S. priorities toward ousting Assad. Pressed to clarify, McMaster said the goals of fighting IS and ousting Syria's president were somewhat \"simultaneous\" and that the objective of the missile strike was to send a \"strong political message to Assad.\" He did not rule out additional strikes if Assad continued to engage in atrocities against rebel forces with either chemical or conventional weapons. \"We are prepared to do more,\" he said. \"The president will make whatever decision he thinks is in the best interest of the American people.\" Reluctant to put significant troops on the ground in Syria, the U.S. for years has struggled to prevent Assad from strengthening his hold on power. U.S.-backed rebels groups have long pleaded for more U.S. intervention and complained that Washington has only fought the Islamic State group. So Trump's decision to launch the strikes — which President Barack Obama declined to do after a 2013 chemical attack — has raised optimism among rebels that Trump will more directly confront Assad. Several lawmakers said Sunday that decision shouldn't entirely be up to Trump. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the no. 2 Republican in the Senate, praised Trump's initial missile strike for sending a message to Assad, Russia, Iran and North Korea that \"there's a new administration in charge.\" But he said Trump now needed to work with Congress to set a future course. \"Congress needs to work with the president to try and deal with this long-term strategy, lack of strategy, really, in Syria,\" he said. \"We haven't had one for six years during the Obama administration, and 400,000 civilians have died and millions of people have been displaced internally and externally in Europe and elsewhere.\" Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, agreed. \"What we saw was a reaction to the use of chemical weapons, something I think many of us supported,\" he said. \"But what we did not see is a coherent policy on how we're going to deal with the civil war and also deal with ISIS.\" Still, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he believed that Trump didn't need to consult with Congress. \"I think the president has authorization to use force,\" he said. \"Assad signed the chemical weapons treaty ban. There's an agreement with him not to use chemical weapons.\" Their comments came as Tillerson was making the Trump administration's first official trip this week to Russia, a staunch Assad ally. In interviews broadcast Sunday, Tillerson said defeating the Islamic State group remains the top focus. Once that threat \"has been reduced or eliminated, I think we can turn our attention directly to stabilizing the situation in Syria,\" he said. \"We're hopeful that we can prevent a continuation of the civil war and that we can bring the parties to the table to begin the process of political discussions\" between the Assad government and various rebel groups. The hope, he said, is that \"we can navigate a political outcome in which the Syrian people, in fact, will determine Bashar al-Assad's fate and his legitimacy.\" Haley said \"getting Assad out is not the only priority\" and that countering Iran's influence in Syria was another. Still, Haley said the U.S. didn't see a peaceful future Syria with Assad in power. McMaster, Cornyn and Cardin spoke on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Tillerson appeared on ABC's \"This Week\" and CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Haley and Graham were on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and Haley also appeared on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" ___ Associated Press writer Josh Lederman contributed to this report.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/6d9da3ee01df44829a7878bad18998c2/trump-officials-say-no-new-us-focus-ousting-syrias-assad\n\n\n\nTitle:\nSuicide bombers kill 44 at Palm Sunday services in Egypt\nDescription:\nTANTA, Egypt (AP) — Suicide bombers struck hours apart at two Coptic churches in northern Egypt, killing 44 people and turning Palm Sunday services into scenes of horror and outrage at the government that led the president to call for a three-month state of emergency. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the violence, adding to fears that extremists are shifting their focus to civilians, especially Egypt's Christian minority. The attacks in the northern cities of Tanta and Alexandria that also left 126 people wounded came at the start of Holy Week leading up to Easter, and just weeks before Pope Francis is due to visit. Pope Tawadros II, the leader of the Coptic church who will meet with Francis on April 28-29, was in the Alexandra cathedral at the time of the bombing but was unhurt, the Interior Ministry said. It was the single deadliest day for Christians in decades and the worst since a bombing at a Cairo church in December killed 30 people. Late Sunday night, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi called for a three-month state of emergency. According to Egypt's constitution, parliament must vote in favor of such a declaration — a virtual certainty since it is packed with supporters of the president. It cannot exceed six months without a referendum to extend it. The army chief-turned-president also dispatched elite troops across the country to protect key installations and accused unidentified countries of fueling instability, saying that \"Egyptians have foiled plots and efforts by countries and fascist, terrorist organizations that tried to control Egypt.\" The attacks highlighted the difficulties facing el-Sissi's government in protecting Christians, who make up about 10 percent of Egypt's population. \"Where is the government?\" screamed an angry Maged Saleh, who rushed to the church in the Nile Delta city of Tanta where his mother escaped the carnage. \"There is no government!\" The first bomb exploded inside St. George's Church in Tanta, killing at least 27 people and wounding 78, officials said, overturning pews, shattering windows and staining the whitewashed walls with blood. Video from inside the church broadcast by CBC TV showed people gathered around what appeared to be lifeless, bloody bodies covered with papers. Several doors had been blown off. Women wailed outside. \"After the explosion, everything became dark from the smoke,\" said Edmond Edward, attending Mass with his brother, Emil, who suffered head wounds and leaned on him for support at a nearby hospital. \"There was a clear lapse in security, which must be tightened from now on to save lives,\" he told The Associated Press. The blast appeared to be centered near the altar, he said. Susan Mikhail, whose apartment balcony across the street has a clear view of the church and its front yard, said the explosion violently shook her building. \"Deacons were the first to run out of the church. Many of them had blood on their white robes,\" she told the AP. The more seriously wounded then were carried out by other survivors and taken to hospitals in private cars, she said. Hundreds of residents gathered in the area, and church members blocked people from entering the church as police cordoned off the area. A few hours later, a suicide bomber rushed toward St. Mark's Cathedral in the coastal city of Alexandria, the historic seat of Christendom in Egypt, killing at least 17 people and wounding 48. CCTV images showed a man with a blue sweater tied over his shoulders approaching the main gate to St. Mark's and then being turned away by security and directed toward a metal detector. He passed a female police officer talking to another woman, and entered a metal detector before an explosion engulfed the area. The Health Ministry said six Muslims were among the dead in Alexandria. Pope Tawadros II had held Palm Sunday services at the cathedral and the timing of the attack indicated the bomber had sought to assassinate him. Pope Francis marked Palm Sunday in St. Peter's Square by expressing \"deep condolences to my brother, Pope Tawadros II, the Coptic church and all of the dear Egyptian nation.\" Magdy George Youssef, a deacon at St. George's, said the church was almost full when the blast occurred and threw him under a pew. \"All I could think of was to find my wife, and all I could see was smoke, blood and completely charred bodies,\" the distraught 58-year-old said. Youssef, who suffered only an injured ear, later found his wife at home, with burns to her face. IS said in a statement that two Egyptian suicide bombers named Abu Ishaq al Masri and Abu al Baraa al Masri carried out the church attacks and vowed to continue attacks against Christians. \"What happened is a dangerous indicator that shows how easy it is to attack a large gathering of people in different places,\" said researcher Ishaq Ibrahim with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. \"There is a complete government failure in taking the IS threat seriously.\" El-Sissi said in a statement that Sunday's attacks would only strengthen the resolve of Egyptians against \"evil forces.\" He held an emergency meeting of the National Defense Council, which includes the prime minister, the defense and interior ministers, the speaker of parliament and top army commanders and security chiefs. Regional police chief Brig. Gen. Hossam Elddin Khalifa was fired over the Tanta bombing, with Maj. Gen. Tarek Hassouna replacing him, state-run newspaper al-Ahram reported. President Donald Trump tweeted that he is \"so sad to hear of the terrorist attack\" against the U.S. ally but added that he has \"great confidence\" that el-Sissi \"will handle the situation properly.\" The two leaders met at the White House on April 3. Grand Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, head of Egypt's Al-Azhar — the leading center of learning in Sunni Islam — also condemned the attacks, calling them a \"despicable terrorist bombing that targeted the lives of innocents.\" Both Israel and the Islamic Hamas movement ruling neighboring Gaza condemned the bombings as well. An Islamic State affiliate claimed the December bombing as well as a string of killings in the northern Sinai that forced hundreds of Christians to flee to safer areas. The militants recently vowed to step up attacks against Christians, whom they regard as infidels. Egypt has struggled to combat a wave of Islamic militancy since the 2013 military overthrow of an elected Islamist president. The Sinai-based IS affiliate has mainly attacked police and soldiers, but has also claimed bombings including the downing of a Russian passenger jetliner in the Sinai in 2015, which killed all 224 people aboard and devastated Egypt's tourism industry. Egypt's Copts are one of the oldest Christian communities in the Middle East and have long complained of discrimination and that the government does not do enough to protect them. Security at churches is routinely increased around religious holidays. The Copts largely supported the military overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, and incurred the wrath of many of his followers, who attacked churches and other Christian institutions. While the Copts have stood steadfast alongside the government, an increase in attacks on Christians has tested that support. Egyptian media had previously reported that the church in Tanta had been targeted before, with a bomb defused there in late March. As night fell, hundreds of Christians, mostly clad in black, streamed to the church to offer their condolences. Scuffles broke out between the mourners and church volunteers guarding the church's doors as many pushed and shoved to get in. ___ Associated Press writers Maggie Michael, Brian Rohan, Menna Zaki and Maamoun Youssef in Cairo and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed to this report.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/88b8fef3a96e433c902a303cd5db928e/egypt-state-media-bombing-church-nile-delta\n\n\n\nTitle:\nTillerson&#039;s Russia trip highlights emergence from shadows\nDescription:\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Criticized for his low-profile diplomacy, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is emerging from the shadows with a leading public role in shaping and explaining the Trump administration's missile strikes in Syria. And, he's set for an even higher-profile mission, heading to Moscow under the twin clouds of Russia's U.S. election meddling and its possible support for a Syrian chemical weapons attack. Since taking office in February, the former Exxon Mobil CEO has admittedly shunned the spotlight and the press. Yet, Tillerson was surprisingly visible during last week's announcement of the response to the gruesome chemical attack, fielding questions from reporters on and off camera, and then captured in an official White House photo seated next to President Donald Trump as they heard the result of the 59 cruise missiles that struck a Syrian military base. Tillerson was a prominent fixture during the most important foreign policy period in Trump's young presidency: a two-day summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping that coincided with the strikes against Syria. He was by Trump's side during his meetings with Xi and spoke publicly multiple times to address both issues. It was Tillerson who delivered the Trump administration's first blistering condemnation of Russia in the hours after the strikes. Standing in a cramped conference room alongside national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Tillerson said Moscow had \"failed\" to live up to its obligations under a 2013 agreement to strip Syria of its chemical weapons stockpiles. \"Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has simply been incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement,\" he said. On Sunday, he made his first network television interview appearances. In one interview, Tillerson said he sees no reason for retaliation from Russia for the U.S. missile strikes. Russia maintains a close political and military alliance with President Bashar Assad's government and has been accused of supporting its attacks against Syrians opposed to Assad's rule — something Moscow adamantly denies. Tillerson said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that Russians were not targeted by the strikes. He also said the top U.S. priority in the region hadn't changed and remained the defeat of Islamic State militants. Then he headed to Europe to gather with the foreign ministers of the other major industrialized nations before venturing on eastward to become the first Trump Cabinet member to visit Moscow — and possibly meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The criticism from the foreign policy establishment's left and right that has dogged Tillerson's tenure is dying down. Tillerson had faced questions about whether he understood that his new position meant he was now the face of the United States to the world, that he had to answer no longer to a small group of top shareholders but to more than 320 million Americans. The secretary of state must be \"the spokesman for American foreign policy,\" said Eliot Cohen, a senior State Department official during George W. Bush's presidency. \"This is the administration's first crisis but it won't be their last by a long shot, so he's going to have to get used to this.\" Joining Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, Tillerson was supposed to focus on the informal summit with Xi. Instead, he was thrust to the forefront after photos of the bodies piled in heaps in Idlib, Syria, dramatically altered the agenda. Only a week earlier, Tillerson had alarmed U.S. allies by indicating the U.S. was no longer interested in pushing for Assad's removal from power. In the hours leading up to Trump's decision to order the strikes, Tillerson was among the most forward-leaning of Trump's top aides in suggesting the U.S. would deliver an \"appropriate response.\" He challenged Russia publicly in a way Trump appeared scrupulously to avoid and said of Assad early Thursday: \"It would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people.\" After the cruise missiles crashed down in Syria, Tillerson was calm and commanding in a question-and-answer session with journalists. Cohen, a conservative critic of Trump's foreign policy who has chided Tillerson for his reticence, said he saw Tillerson growing into the job. \"I suspect you'll see more of him as he grows more comfortable in dealing with the press and in his relationship with the president and the administration's national security team,\" Cohen said. The challenge will be greater in Russia's capital this week. Tillerson is arriving at a fragile point in U.S.-Russia relations, where he will have to confront the Kremlin's anger over the missile strikes in Syria along with suspicion at home that Moscow may have been complicit in the Syrian government's chemical weapons attack. Senior U.S. military officials have said they are looking into whether Russia provided drone surveillance and helped Syrian forces try to cover up what they'd done. \"I think that there will be a lot of answers that come out of that meeting. And I think that's when the president will make his decisions,\" said Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, during an appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Beyond Syria are disputes over Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. At the same time, Tillerson carries to Moscow the weight of FBI and congressional investigations into Russia's interference in last year's presidential election. The Trump campaign's possible ties to the presumed Russian meddlers are also under scrutiny. \"This is going to be Tillerson's biggest test to date,\" said Julianne Smith, a National Security Council and Defense Department official under President Barack Obama. When he goes to Russia, keeping a low profile would likely be impossible, even if it were his goal. ___ Associated Press writers Josh Lederman and Julie Pace contributed to this report.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/1e8bda8a75104d02b4606c5c397af8bc/tillerson-steps-syria-russia-after-avoiding-spotlight\n\n\n\nTitle:\nNew report gives US airlines better grades across the board\nDescription:\nDALLAS (AP) — The airlines are getting better at sticking to their schedules and are losing fewer bags. Their customers seem to be complaining less often. Those are the findings of an annual report on airline quality being released Monday by researchers at Wichita State University and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The researchers use information compiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation to rate the airlines for on-time performance, baggage handling, bumping passengers off oversold flights, and complaints filed with the government. They planned to release their list of the best airlines later Monday. The report's general observations: — ON TIME PERFORMANCE: The percentage of flights that arrived on time or close enough rose to 81.4 percent in 2016 from 79.9 percent in 2015. Of 12 leading U.S. carriers, only American, JetBlue and Virgin America got worse. — LOST BAGS: The rate of bags being lost, stolen or delayed fell 17 percent. — BUMPING PASSENGERS: Your chances of getting bumped by the airline dropped 18 percent, which doesn't include people who voluntarily gave up their seat for money or a travel voucher. — FEWER COMPLAINTS: The rate of complaints filed with the government dropped about one-fifth, with complaints rising only for Hawaiian and Virgin America. The official complaint rates don't include the larger number of complaints that passengers file directly with the airline. The airlines are not required to report those figures. Clearly, however, airlines still have a perception problem. It's not hard to find passengers who complain about a miserable flight, a missed connection, or shabby treatment by airline employees. Comments like that abound on Twitter. \"People don't look at the numbers,\" said Dean Headley, a marketing professor at Wichita State and co-author of Monday's report. \"They just know what happened to them, or they hear what happened to other people.\" The Wichita State and Embry-Riddle researchers have been doing their report for more than 25 years, making it useful for comparing airlines. But some observers of the airline industry dismiss their number-crunching approach, and there are many other surveys that purport to rank the airlines. The Transportation Department counts a flight as being on time even if it arrives up to 14 minutes late. \"Airlines are happy with that (grace period) because it makes them look better and misleads the passenger,\" said aviation consultant Michael Baiada. He said airlines can do better, and besides, travelers pay to be on time — not 14 minutes late. More broadly, a statistical analysis of government data \"really doesn't take into consideration how the customer is treated,\" said Bryan Saltzburg, an executive with travel site TripAdvisor LLC. \"How comfortable are they on the plane? How helpful is the staff? What's the value for what the customer paid?\" TripAdvisor released its own airline rankings Monday, which it said were based on analysis of \"hundreds of thousands\" of reviews posted by users. It placed JetBlue and Alaska Airlines among the top 10 in the world, and it rated Delta ahead of American and United among the largest U.S. carriers. Other outfits including J.D. Power and Skytrax also put out ratings. Airlines boast when they win. Recently, American Airlines started putting stickers on all 968 of its planes to note that a trade publication, Air Transport World, named it airline of the year. ___ David Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/0c8396e963e14be69be4951d08cfb84e/new-report-gives-us-airlines-better-grades-across-board\n\n\n\nTitle:\nFord says hybrid police car catches bad guys, saves gas too\nDescription:\nDEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — The next time the cops chase you down for speeding, they could be driving a fuel-efficient gas-electric hybrid. Ford Motor Co., which sells more police cars in the U.S. than any other automaker, says it will offer a police pursuit version of the hybrid Fusion midsize sedan, in response to requests from cities nationwide. The new car, with its 2-Liter four-cylinder engine and 1.4 kilowatt lithium-ion battery, is expected to get 38 miles per gallon of gas in combined city-highway driving. That's 20 mpg more than Ford's current police car, the Taurus police interceptor. The hybrids won't be as fast as the Taurus with a 3.7-Liter turbocharged V6, but Ford expects it to be quick enough to earn a pursuit rating when tested later this year by the Michigan State Police and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the first hybrid to earn that honor. To get a pursuit rating, cars have to perform well in acceleration, handling, braking, top speed and ergonomics and make the list of cars that the Michigan and Los Angeles agencies would buy. When the throttle is held down for five seconds, the car will go into pursuit mode, using both the electric motor and the gas engine for maximum performance, Ford said. The company also says the car will be durable for tough police duties. Police cars spend much of their days idling by the side of a road, and that's where the hybrid has a true advantage, Ford said. The gas engine will shut off at idle with the battery handling the electrical load for flashers, radios and other items. It will restart to recharge the battery. Ford said at $2.50 per gallon for gas, the hybrid would save a police department $3,877 per year in fuel costs per vehicle. The price of the hybrid, available in the fall of 2018, isn't being released just yet. Ford was to unveil the police car Monday with press conferences in New York and Los Angeles. One already has been outfitted to look like a Los Angeles police cruiser. While big-city departments might be most interested in the fuel savings, the cars might also be appealing to small departments. Thomas Korabik, chief of the 10-officer North Muskegon, Michigan, Police Department, said his city spends about $22,000 per year on gasoline for four cruisers and would be interested in cutting that in half. But he wonders if the Fusion is big enough inside to carry computers, radios and other equipment. Many departments have switched to SUVs to handle the equipment, said Korabik, who also is president of the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police. \"Anytime you can save money it is good,\" he said. \"I'd want to see the car first and see how it would hold up.\" Todd Soderquist, Ford's chief engineer for the Fusion Police Responder, conceded the car is smaller than other cruisers on the outside. \"Internally, you'll be surprised at how comparable they are,\" he said.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/295bbfe0f9f64fbea758e0119311b891/ford-says-hybrid-police-car-catches-bad-guys-saves-gas-too\n\n\n\nTitle:\nHawaii LGBT couples seek equal access to fertility treatment\nDescription:\nHONOLULU (AP) — Sean Smith and his husband paid more than $20,000 for a fertility procedure when they decided to have a child using a surrogate mother. They did not know at the time that if they were a heterosexual couple, they might have saved that money. Now, Smith and other members of Hawaii's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community are lobbying for equal access to the financial help married, heterosexual couples enjoy under state law. They are pushing legislation that would require insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization for more couples, including making Hawaii the first state to require the coverage for surrogates, which would help male same-sex couples who must use a surrogate. \"Now that marriage equality is the law of the land and is accepted, now let's turn to family building, and let's figure out how we fix all these inequities that exist,\" said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of Resolve, a national organization that advocates for access to fertility treatments. Hawaii is one of eight states that require insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization, a costly procedure where a doctor retrieves eggs from a woman, combines them with sperm from a man and then implants an embryo into a woman's uterus. But Hawaii's mandate applies only to married heterosexual couples because it covers the medical intervention only if a woman uses sperm from her spouse, leaving the LGBT community and single women behind. \"At the end of the visit, I would be going into the office and pulling out my credit card, and other people are probably just walking out and insurance is picking up the tab,\" Smith said. \"We had to borrow money, refinance a second mortgage, and I'm sure there are people who don't even explore the option because the expenses are too great.\" The measure pending in the Hawaii Legislature removes requirements that the egg and sperm come from a married couple and includes surrogates among the people to be covered. No other state has included surrogates in their laws, Collura said. \"It is definitely groundbreaking,\" Collura said. \"And it's an often-overlooked way that people choose to build their family, and it should not be left out. It's great to see that Hawaii is taking the lead.\" Kaiser Permanente Hawaii opposed the measure, saying the medical provider and insurer does not perform in vitro fertilization with donor eggs or surrogates because of complex legal issues and medical risks. The company asked lawmakers to remove egg donors and surrogates from the bill, saying requiring coverage of additional procedures would raise costs for the company and its customers. A similar measure in Hawaii failed in previous legislative sessions. But aside from Kaiser, the bill has seen little opposition this year. A broad coalition including the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii, the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission and the Democratic Party of Hawaii are working with LGBT groups to push for change. The proposal passed the state Senate and is up for a vote in the House this week. Maryland had a law that also excluded same-sex couples until about a year ago, when the Legislature changed the provision so it no longer required using a husband's sperm. That helped lesbian couples, but gay men were still left out because the law didn't cover surrogates, Collura said. Most state mandates limit insurance reimbursement to a certain number of in vitro fertilization trials or allow coverage only after years of infertility. Some states also allow religious or small employers to get out of the requirement. \"We need to change these laws,\" Collura said. \"We need to update them and make them so that they are no longer discriminatory.\"\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/9c86d06eab8b49e3818597834d6571f8/hawaii-lgbt-couples-seek-equal-access-fertility-treatment\n\n\n\nTitle:\nNew York derailment highlights US infrastructure concerns\nDescription:\nWhen a train jumped the tracks this past week at New York's Penn Station, the seemingly minor accident led to a cascade of exasperating delays for hundreds of thousands of commuters. When a flood forced authorities to condemn a one-lane, century-old bridge in rural Ozark, Missouri, it was no less frustrating for the residents and business owners cut off from their shortest route into town. The two episodes highlight a reality about the U.S. transportation system — it is aging, congested and so vital that when things go wrong, big and costly disruptions can result for which there is no quick fix. Though President Donald Trump has promised a $1 trillion infrastructure-rebuilding program, not all of that may go toward transportation. Even then, it would fall well short of the many trillions needed to fix the country's web of roads, bridges, railways, subways and bus stations. The commuter train in New York derailed because of a weakened railroad tie. No one was seriously injured. But the incident shut down eight of the station's 21 tracks, disrupting Amtrak service in the Northeast from Boston to Washington, as well as delaying commuter trains in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for the better part of a week. Business meetings were canceled, ballgames, dinners and doctor's appointments missed, and commuters fumed. Lawyer Dominic Boone, who travels into New York from New Jersey, complained that because he arrived late to the office and had to leave early to catch a different train, he lost 10 hours of work for which he could have billed clients. \"They should have been working on Penn Station forever ago,\" Boone said. \"As a nation, we should be spending more on our crumbling infrastructure.\" The disruption was only a brief example of the frustration travelers could face if the region can't find a way to replace a pair of deteriorating, overcrowded, century-old rail tunnels that run under the Hudson River and connect New York and New Jersey. The tunnels, which were severely damaged in Superstorm Sandy in 2012, could cost more than $20 billion to replace. But the money has yet to be lined up. And construction, whenever it begins, may take more than a decade. The Penn Station derailment came less than two weeks after another one there, caused by a misaligned track. And it happened just days after motorists in Atlanta were forced to begin taking long, bumper-to-bumper detours because a fire collapsed an Interstate 85 overpass linking the city to some of its biggest suburbs. Arson — not aging steel and concrete — is suspected there. It could take until mid-June to repair the highway. Earlier this year, a cracked steel beam forced the closing of a major bridge between Pennsylvania and New Jersey for 1½ months. Improving the nation's roads and bridges would require $120 billion a year through 2020, according to a recent U.S. Department of Transportation estimate. But annual spending at all levels of government is just $88 billion. And the nation's mass transit systems have over a $90 billion backlog of maintenance and repair needs. The capacity of the nation's transportation system is lagging behind population growth, leading to ever greater congestion. By 2040, nearly 30,000 miles of the nation's busiest highways are expected to be clogged on a daily basis. Rural communities also face challenges, partly because they have fewer residents over whom to spread the cost of transportation improvements. Grant County, Oklahoma, for example, has more than 3,500 bridges with a population of about 4,500 and an economy based on agriculture and energy production. \"While this infrastructure was ideal 70 years ago for transporting livestock and crops, it is inadequate to support today's heavier trucks, increased traffic and higher operating needs,\" county commission chairwoman Cindy Bobbitt told U.S. senators at a recent hearing. The complexities of government can sometimes slow down improvements, as cities, counties, states, port authorities, special taxing districts and federal agencies all have a say in which projects get built, when to do the work and how to pay the bills. Plans for wider roads and new rail lines can also face opposition from the communities they pass through because of concerns about noise, pollution and diminished property values. \"Of course I believe there needs to be more\" infrastructure investment, said Martin Wachs, a retired professor of civil and environmental engineering and urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"At the same time, political decisions have to be made that weigh that against investments in education and health care and so forth.\" At least 20 states have raised taxes or fees for transportation over the past five years. California became the latest to do so Thursday, as legislators passed a bill to raise $5 billion annually through higher fuel taxes and vehicle fees to pay for road and bridge repairs, public transit and pedestrian trails. The plan tackles part of a $137 billion backlog of deferred maintenance on state highways and local roads. It came together after a destructive winter in which flooding caused nearly $600 million in damage to highways. Indiana and Tennessee are among other states considering raising fuel taxes and fees for transportation this year. In Ozark, a town of fewer than 20,000 people in Missouri, voters approved a transportation sales tax Tuesday of three-eighths of a cent, with some of the proceeds going toward a new, $3 million two-lane bridge to replace the narrow structure that has been closed since it was damaged by flooding in 2015. The bridge closing has forced 75-year-old Gary Jenks to drive an extra 10 minutes along a circuitous route every time he needs to go the doctor or pharmacy or visit his family on the opposite side of town. \"It's just been a total inconvenience and a burden,\" Jenks said. ___ Associated Press reporter Karen Matthews contributed from New York.

The U.S. women's national soccer team struck a new collective bargaining agreement with their federation, ending more than a year of at times contentious negotiations, with players seeking comparable compensation to the men's national team. It followed the U.S. national hockey team's deal with USA Hockey after players threatened to boycott the women's world championships over wages. The quest for better pay and conditions even extended across the Atlantic to Ireland, where the women's national soccer team there threatened to sit out of an exhibition match this week. \"It's pretty incredible what the women's hockey team did and they were courageous in their fight. There were differences between our battle and their battle, but they were inspirational,\" U.S. midfielder Megan Rapinoe said. \"For us and them, we were able to inspire other teams.\" The actions of these teams highlight the struggle for female athletes to achieve fair compensation for their efforts, even if that doesn't mean identical paychecks to their male counterparts. 'Fair' can include even simple items like access to changing rooms, in the case of the Irish players. It is not a new fight. Back in 1995, a group of high-profile players including Michelle Akers, Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm and Kristine Lilly were locked out of a pre-Olympic training camp because of a disagreement over bonus pay with the U.S. Soccer Federation. The dispute was quickly settled and women's soccer made its debut at the 1996 Atlanta Games. The United States won the gold. Following the team's victory on penalty kicks in the 1999 World Cup final against China, the players boycotted a tournament in Australia. They eventually came to terms on a deal with the federation that extended through the 2004 Athens Olympics. Inspired by the soccer players, Olympian Cammi Granato pushed USA Hockey in 2000 for better conditions and pay. The hockey team was coming off a gold-medal-winning run in the 1998 Nagano Games, the first Olympics that included the women's game as a sport. With the help John Langel, the same lawyer who helped the soccer team strike its deal, the players sent a letter to the federation outlining their concerns. Lacking leverage to move the effort forward, it failed and the issue was largely dropped — until this year. Langel also helped the team reach its current agreement before the world championships. This time, a social media hashtag, #BeBoldForChange, helped make the cause an international sensation. \"I think that this is just the beginning, and I think you're going to see more of this. We are reaching the next level of women's sports,\" said U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. \"At the beginning it was just allowing women to play, then it was making sure they got funded in the schools so they could play, and now we're reaching that biggest pinnacle, which is really getting them to the point where people are watching them as much as they watch men. And we're not quite there yet, but the only way we get there is by using examples like what just happened with hockey and moving it out into other sports.\" Ireland's national team, made up mostly of amateurs with day jobs, wasn't getting even basic financial support for things like compensation for time off from work while on international duty. Players said they'd been forced to dress in public restrooms and had to share team-branded apparel with the junior national teams. The women held a news conference decrying the conditions. It won the team public sympathy and helped force the Football Association of Ireland to work out an agreement with the women. Goalkeeper Emma Byrne posted to Twitter: \"Victory! Thank you for all your support. It proves unity is a powerful force.\" There have been other successes, too. The Australian women's national soccer team, capitalizing on the team's surprising play in the 2015 World Cup, boycotted friendlies in the United States and wound up negotiating a deal that got them better wages, bonuses and travel provisions. In tennis, Grand Slam events and many other tournaments give equal prize money to men and women. But lingering sexism flared up last year when Raymond Moore, director of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, made comments that outraged many and forced his resignation. \"In my next life when I come back I want to be someone in the WTA because they ride on the coattails of the men. They don't make any decisions and they are lucky. They are very, very lucky,\" Moore said at the time. The backlash showed that Moore's opinion was an outdated and tired trope. Women's sports are more popular than ever, thanks in part to Title IX, which spurred increased female participation at the college level. The internet has given fans greater access to the games and its stars. That's been coupled with some amazing performances by female athletes and teams in recent years: From Serena Williams' dominance on the tennis court to Carli Lloyd's hat trick in the 2015 Women's World Cup final to UConn's supremacy of college basketball. On Friday night, the U.S. women's hockey team capped an emotional two weeks with a thrilling 3-2 overtime win over Canada in the world championship final. \"If anything that we did can inspire anyone — sports, girls, boys, out of sports, whatever — to stand up for what they believe in, I think that's a huge plus,\" team captain Meghan Duggan said.

It quickly escalated into something more sinister. Soon a pig's head was buried in the ground at the future Nangang mosque, the culmination of a rally in which dozens of residents hoisted banners and circled the planned building site. Then the mosque's imam received a text message carrying a death threat: \"In case someone in your family dies, I have a coffin for you — and more than one, if necessary.\" \"How did things get stirred up to this point?\" the imam, Tao Yingsheng, said in a recent interview. \"Who had even heard of the Nangang mosque before?\" On the dusty plains of the Chinese heartland, a bitter fight over a mosque exemplifies how a surge in anti-Muslim sentiment online is spreading into communities across China, exacerbating simmering ethnic and religious tensions that have in the past erupted in bloodshed. It's also posing a dilemma for the ruling Communist Party, which has allowed Islamophobia to fester online for years as part of its campaign to justify security crackdowns in its restive region of Xinjiang. \"It's let the genie out of the bottle,\" said James Leibold, a professor at La Trobe University in Australia who has tracked the growth of anti-Muslim hate speech on China's internet. Interviews with residents and an examination of social media show how a few disparate online complaints by local homeowners evolved into a concerted campaign to spread hate. Key to it was an unexpected yet influential backer: a Chinese propaganda official, 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles) away in Xinjiang, whose inflammatory social media posts helped draw people into the streets on New Year's Day, resulting in a police crackdown. ___ A stone inscription outside its gate shows the original Nangang mosque was established in the 1780s by members of the Hui minority, the descendants of Silk Road traders who settled across China centuries ago. In its present form, the mosque has served the area's 4,500 Hui for decades, its domed silhouette partially hidden by overgrown shrubs in the countryside beyond Hefei's last paved boulevards. Over the past 10 years urbanization has come to Hefei, with sprawling development reconfiguring the landscape and its demographic flavor, and Hui leaders had been pushing for years to relocate their mosque to a more convenient urban location. City planners in November finally selected a site adjacent to the newly built Hangkong New City condominiums, with its $200,000 two-bedroom units, faux-Mediterranean stylings and a Volvo dealership across the street. The project's homeowners overwhelmingly members of China's ethnic Han majority began complaining on China's popular microblog, Weibo. Some complained the mosque would occupy space promised for a park. Others warned that safety in the area would be compromised. Others were more blunt: Han residents were uncomfortable that a center for Hui community life would be less than 100 meters (300 feet) from their building, a homeowner who later identified himself in messages to the AP by his surname, Cheng, wrote in a petition posted in December. \"And the less said about what happens on Eid al-Adha, the better,\" Cheng wrote, referring to the Islamic holiday in which animals are slaughtered for a sacrificial feast. \"It's absolutely shocking.\" The story soon caught the attention of Cui Zijian, a boyish-looking propaganda official in Xinjiang who writes about the threat of religious extremism on his Weibo account with nearly 30,000 followers. On Dec. 16, Cui suggested homeowners lobby local officials to block the construction, adding: \"If that doesn't work, then how about pig head, pig blood.\" Cui followed that a few hours later with another post repeating the four Chinese characters for pig blood and pig head over and over, attracting hundreds of reposts. While Cui was criticized by some on Weibo, a larger number — including at least one other government propaganda official — took his post as their cue to hurl abuse at the Hui. ___ The mosque dispute was just the latest flashpoint for an increasingly active anti-Muslim social media movement in China. A video of a Hui girl reciting the Quran in Arabic sparked outrage last May over so-called terrorist infiltration of Chinese schools, prompting officials to announce a \"strict ban\" on religion on campuses. Online activists derailed a Hui official's effort to regulate the halal food industry, arguing that religion was creeping into the officially atheistic Chinese state. Han Chinese, who make up 95 percent of the population, have long grumbled about the dozens of China's officially recognized minority groups receiving advantages on the hyper-competitive college entrance exams or exemptions from family-size limits, but online abuse has increasingly targeted Muslims. The rise in Islamophobia comes as Chinese have been buffeted by news of militant attacks in Europe, while at home, violence in Xinjiang and elsewhere has been blamed on Muslim separatists. Beijing has responded to the bloody, years-long insurgency from Muslim Uighur minorities in Xinjiang with further restrictions on Islamic expression, a move rights groups warn could potentially radicalize moderate Muslims. Such policies have also drawn vows of retaliation from the Islamic State and al-Qaeda. Ethnic hostility can only deepen, scholars say, when the government stops discussion of the plight of Muslims or ethnic policies while allowing anti-Muslim rhetoric and hate speech to go unchecked. In 2014, Uighur scholar Ilham Tohti, who had founded a website to host debates about ethnic tensions in Xinjiang, was sentenced to life in prison on separatism charges. Government censors go after descriptions of abuses against Muslims, but \"it doesn't take long whatsoever to find incredibly Islamophobic things that seem to be not censored at all,\" said William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International, which has appealed for Tohti's release. Political observers say the recent rise of a faction within the Communist Party advocating for a hard-line approach on religious affairs has coincided with the rise of government-linked commentators who openly warn about the danger of Islam. \"Interest groups have actively promoted Islamophobia in interior regions in order to create a nationwide environment that justifies Xinjiang's anti-terrorism campaign,\" said Ma Haiyun, a history professor specializing in China's Muslims at Frostburg State University in Maryland. \"There's an Islamophobic movement that aims at creating chaos and even conflicts at the local level.\" After briefly moderating his remarks about the Nangang mosque, the propaganda official, Cui, renewed his criticism in February with an essay arguing that his professional and patriotic duty was to resist extremism. His online speech about Muslims was part of the job, he said. \"For that, we're labeled Muslim-smearers,\" wrote Cui, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment. \"But it is those who instigate a fear of Islam, precisely the terrorists and the extremists, who are the ones smearing Muslims.\" Reached in March, an official at the propaganda department where he worked refused to comment on Cui's involvement in the controversy. But Cui now appears to be even better positioned to influence discourse: The official said Cui was transferred in February to work in the cyberspace administration, the agency in charge of censoring online speech. ___ Tao, the 50-year old imam, recalled the day in December when he heard his mosque was suddenly the subject of thousands of posts and hundreds of comments on Weibo, a service he barely used. He soon found himself soothing local Hui who approached him, shaken by what they were seeing online. \"They said people were planning to hang a pig's head outside our mosque. I said, 'Then we'll remove it.' They said people will bury a pig's head in the ground. I said 'Why can't we just dig it up?'\" Tao said. After protesters followed through with the threat at the New Year's Day demonstration, police detained two protest leaders for two weeks and summoned others for questioning, according to residents. Since then Han indignation has gave way to quiet seething. \"People have been scared into silence,\" said Cheng, the Han tea seller. During a recent visit to Hangkong New City, homeowners repeated the government's mantra that ethnic unity was important, but complained that officials sacrificed their interests to appease a minority. \"If 99 percent of our compound is Han, it doesn't seem appropriate that they put a mosque next door,\" said a middle-aged woman who said her surname was Han. Ma Jianhua, a Nangang district planning official, told the AP that construction will proceed after his office \"appropriately handled\" homeowners' petitions, but declined to elaborate. The mosque dispute has left the city's Hui community on the defensive, with many eager to emphasize their desire to peacefully coexist with their Han neighbors as well as their confidence in the government's handling of the situation. At a ranch past the undulating rapeseed field that separates the condos from rubble-strewn Huimin Lu — Hui People's Road — workers at what is one of the few Hui businesses that hasn't been demolished to make way for high-rises expressed surprise about the mosque dispute, given the area's history of ethnic mingling. \"We've been in these parts a long time,\" a worker surnamed Tao, who is not related to the imam, said as he loaded sacks of dried fatty beef. \"We mind our business and they mind theirs. We don't stir up trouble and they don't either.\" But Tao, the imam, seemed to acknowledge a hardening of attitudes toward Muslims in recent years. \"It may be that the situation has grown more sensitive in that place that we all know about,\" he said after a pause, referring to but not daring to mention Xinjiang. Still he tries to not harbor resentment toward the Han protesters. \"I don't blame the locals because I believe they were influenced,\" he said, sitting below framed pictures of him greeting government religious affairs officials. \"I want them to know Muslims are virtuous people. We are peaceful. We are reasonable. We are tolerant.

In his first televised interview, H.R. McMaster pointed to dual U.S. goals of defeating the Islamic State group and removing Assad. But he suggested that Trump was seeking a global political response for regime change from U.S. allies as well as Russia, which he said needed to re-evaluate its support of Syria. \"It's very difficult to understand how a political solution could result from the continuation of the Assad regime,\" McMaster said. \"Now, we are not saying that we are the ones who are going to effect that change. What we are saying is, other countries have to ask themselves some hard questions. Russia should ask themselves ...Why are we supporting this murderous regime that is committing mass murder of its own population?\" After last Tuesday's chemical attack in Syria, Trump said his attitude toward Assad \"has changed very much\" and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said \"steps are underway\" to organize a coalition to remove him from power. But as lawmakers called on Trump to consult with Congress on any future military strikes and a longer-term strategy on Syria, Trump administration officials sent mixed signals on the scope of U.S. involvement. While Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, described regime change in Syria as a U.S. priority and inevitable, Tillerson suggested that last week's American airstrikes in retaliation for the chemical attack hadn't really changed U.S. priorities toward ousting Assad. Pressed to clarify, McMaster said the goals of fighting IS and ousting Syria's president were somewhat \"simultaneous\" and that the objective of the missile strike was to send a \"strong political message to Assad.\" He did not rule out additional strikes if Assad continued to engage in atrocities against rebel forces with either chemical or conventional weapons. \"We are prepared to do more,\" he said. \"The president will make whatever decision he thinks is in the best interest of the American people.\" Reluctant to put significant troops on the ground in Syria, the U.S. for years has struggled to prevent Assad from strengthening his hold on power. U.S.-backed rebels groups have long pleaded for more U.S. intervention and complained that Washington has only fought the Islamic State group. So Trump's decision to launch the strikes — which President Barack Obama declined to do after a 2013 chemical attack — has raised optimism among rebels that Trump will more directly confront Assad. Several lawmakers said Sunday that decision shouldn't entirely be up to Trump. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the no. 2 Republican in the Senate, praised Trump's initial missile strike for sending a message to Assad, Russia, Iran and North Korea that \"there's a new administration in charge.\" But he said Trump now needed to work with Congress to set a future course. \"Congress needs to work with the president to try and deal with this long-term strategy, lack of strategy, really, in Syria,\" he said. \"We haven't had one for six years during the Obama administration, and 400,000 civilians have died and millions of people have been displaced internally and externally in Europe and elsewhere.\" Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, agreed. \"What we saw was a reaction to the use of chemical weapons, something I think many of us supported,\" he said. \"But what we did not see is a coherent policy on how we're going to deal with the civil war and also deal with ISIS.\" Still, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he believed that Trump didn't need to consult with Congress. \"I think the president has authorization to use force,\" he said. \"Assad signed the chemical weapons treaty ban. There's an agreement with him not to use chemical weapons.\" Their comments came as Tillerson was making the Trump administration's first official trip this week to Russia, a staunch Assad ally. In interviews broadcast Sunday, Tillerson said defeating the Islamic State group remains the top focus. Once that threat \"has been reduced or eliminated, I think we can turn our attention directly to stabilizing the situation in Syria,\" he said. \"We're hopeful that we can prevent a continuation of the civil war and that we can bring the parties to the table to begin the process of political discussions\" between the Assad government and various rebel groups. The hope, he said, is that \"we can navigate a political outcome in which the Syrian people, in fact, will determine Bashar al-Assad's fate and his legitimacy.\" Haley said \"getting Assad out is not the only priority\" and that countering Iran's influence in Syria was another. Still, Haley said the U.S. didn't see a peaceful future Syria with Assad in power. McMaster, Cornyn and Cardin spoke on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Tillerson appeared on ABC's \"This Week\" and CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Haley and Graham were on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and Haley also appeared on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" ___ Associated Press writer Josh Lederman contributed to this report.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/6d9da3ee01df44829a7878bad18998c2/trump-officials-say-no-new-us-focus-ousting-syrias-assad\n\n\n\nTitle:\nSuicide bombers kill 44 at Palm Sunday services in Egypt\nDescription:\nTANTA, Egypt (AP) — Suicide bombers struck hours apart at two Coptic churches in northern Egypt, killing 44 people and turning Palm Sunday services into scenes of horror and outrage at the government that led the president to call for a three-month state of emergency. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the violence, adding to fears that extremists are shifting their focus to civilians, especially Egypt's Christian minority. The attacks in the northern cities of Tanta and Alexandria that also left 126 people wounded came at the start of Holy Week leading up to Easter, and just weeks before Pope Francis is due to visit. Pope Tawadros II, the leader of the Coptic church who will meet with Francis on April 28-29, was in the Alexandra cathedral at the time of the bombing but was unhurt, the Interior Ministry said. It was the single deadliest day for Christians in decades and the worst since a bombing at a Cairo church in December killed 30 people. Late Sunday night, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi called for a three-month state of emergency. According to Egypt's constitution, parliament must vote in favor of such a declaration — a virtual certainty since it is packed with supporters of the president. It cannot exceed six months without a referendum to extend it. The army chief-turned-president also dispatched elite troops across the country to protect key installations and accused unidentified countries of fueling instability, saying that \"Egyptians have foiled plots and efforts by countries and fascist, terrorist organizations that tried to control Egypt.\" The attacks highlighted the difficulties facing el-Sissi's government in protecting Christians, who make up about 10 percent of Egypt's population. \"Where is the government?\" screamed an angry Maged Saleh, who rushed to the church in the Nile Delta city of Tanta where his mother escaped the carnage. \"There is no government!\" The first bomb exploded inside St. George's Church in Tanta, killing at least 27 people and wounding 78, officials said, overturning pews, shattering windows and staining the whitewashed walls with blood. Video from inside the church broadcast by CBC TV showed people gathered around what appeared to be lifeless, bloody bodies covered with papers. Several doors had been blown off. Women wailed outside. \"After the explosion, everything became dark from the smoke,\" said Edmond Edward, attending Mass with his brother, Emil, who suffered head wounds and leaned on him for support at a nearby hospital. \"There was a clear lapse in security, which must be tightened from now on to save lives,\" he told The Associated Press. The blast appeared to be centered near the altar, he said. Susan Mikhail, whose apartment balcony across the street has a clear view of the church and its front yard, said the explosion violently shook her building. \"Deacons were the first to run out of the church. Many of them had blood on their white robes,\" she told the AP. The more seriously wounded then were carried out by other survivors and taken to hospitals in private cars, she said. Hundreds of residents gathered in the area, and church members blocked people from entering the church as police cordoned off the area. A few hours later, a suicide bomber rushed toward St. Mark's Cathedral in the coastal city of Alexandria, the historic seat of Christendom in Egypt, killing at least 17 people and wounding 48. CCTV images showed a man with a blue sweater tied over his shoulders approaching the main gate to St. Mark's and then being turned away by security and directed toward a metal detector. He passed a female police officer talking to another woman, and entered a metal detector before an explosion engulfed the area. The Health Ministry said six Muslims were among the dead in Alexandria. Pope Tawadros II had held Palm Sunday services at the cathedral and the timing of the attack indicated the bomber had sought to assassinate him. Pope Francis marked Palm Sunday in St. Peter's Square by expressing \"deep condolences to my brother, Pope Tawadros II, the Coptic church and all of the dear Egyptian nation.\" Magdy George Youssef, a deacon at St. George's, said the church was almost full when the blast occurred and threw him under a pew. \"All I could think of was to find my wife, and all I could see was smoke, blood and completely charred bodies,\" the distraught 58-year-old said. Youssef, who suffered only an injured ear, later found his wife at home, with burns to her face. IS said in a statement that two Egyptian suicide bombers named Abu Ishaq al Masri and Abu al Baraa al Masri carried out the church attacks and vowed to continue attacks against Christians. \"What happened is a dangerous indicator that shows how easy it is to attack a large gathering of people in different places,\" said researcher Ishaq Ibrahim with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. \"There is a complete government failure in taking the IS threat seriously.\" El-Sissi said in a statement that Sunday's attacks would only strengthen the resolve of Egyptians against \"evil forces.\" He held an emergency meeting of the National Defense Council, which includes the prime minister, the defense and interior ministers, the speaker of parliament and top army commanders and security chiefs. Regional police chief Brig. Gen. Hossam Elddin Khalifa was fired over the Tanta bombing, with Maj. Gen. Tarek Hassouna replacing him, state-run newspaper al-Ahram reported. President Donald Trump tweeted that he is \"so sad to hear of the terrorist attack\" against the U.S. ally but added that he has \"great confidence\" that el-Sissi \"will handle the situation properly.\" The two leaders met at the White House on April 3. Grand Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, head of Egypt's Al-Azhar — the leading center of learning in Sunni Islam — also condemned the attacks, calling them a \"despicable terrorist bombing that targeted the lives of innocents.\" Both Israel and the Islamic Hamas movement ruling neighboring Gaza condemned the bombings as well. An Islamic State affiliate claimed the December bombing as well as a string of killings in the northern Sinai that forced hundreds of Christians to flee to safer areas. The militants recently vowed to step up attacks against Christians, whom they regard as infidels. Egypt has struggled to combat a wave of Islamic militancy since the 2013 military overthrow of an elected Islamist president. The Sinai-based IS affiliate has mainly attacked police and soldiers, but has also claimed bombings including the downing of a Russian passenger jetliner in the Sinai in 2015, which killed all 224 people aboard and devastated Egypt's tourism industry. Egypt's Copts are one of the oldest Christian communities in the Middle East and have long complained of discrimination and that the government does not do enough to protect them. Security at churches is routinely increased around religious holidays. The Copts largely supported the military overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, and incurred the wrath of many of his followers, who attacked churches and other Christian institutions. While the Copts have stood steadfast alongside the government, an increase in attacks on Christians has tested that support. Egyptian media had previously reported that the church in Tanta had been targeted before, with a bomb defused there in late March. As night fell, hundreds of Christians, mostly clad in black, streamed to the church to offer their condolences. Scuffles broke out between the mourners and church volunteers guarding the church's doors as many pushed and shoved to get in. ___ Associated Press writers Maggie Michael, Brian Rohan, Menna Zaki and Maamoun Youssef in Cairo and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed to this report.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/88b8fef3a96e433c902a303cd5db928e/egypt-state-media-bombing-church-nile-delta\n\n\n\nTitle:\nTillerson&#039;s Russia trip highlights emergence from shadows\nDescription:\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Criticized for his low-profile diplomacy, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is emerging from the shadows with a leading public role in shaping and explaining the Trump administration's missile strikes in Syria. And, he's set for an even higher-profile mission, heading to Moscow under the twin clouds of Russia's U.S. election meddling and its possible support for a Syrian chemical weapons attack. Since taking office in February, the former Exxon Mobil CEO has admittedly shunned the spotlight and the press. Yet, Tillerson was surprisingly visible during last week's announcement of the response to the gruesome chemical attack, fielding questions from reporters on and off camera, and then captured in an official White House photo seated next to President Donald Trump as they heard the result of the 59 cruise missiles that struck a Syrian military base. Tillerson was a prominent fixture during the most important foreign policy period in Trump's young presidency: a two-day summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping that coincided with the strikes against Syria. He was by Trump's side during his meetings with Xi and spoke publicly multiple times to address both issues. It was Tillerson who delivered the Trump administration's first blistering condemnation of Russia in the hours after the strikes. Standing in a cramped conference room alongside national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Tillerson said Moscow had \"failed\" to live up to its obligations under a 2013 agreement to strip Syria of its chemical weapons stockpiles. \"Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has simply been incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement,\" he said. On Sunday, he made his first network television interview appearances. In one interview, Tillerson said he sees no reason for retaliation from Russia for the U.S. missile strikes. Russia maintains a close political and military alliance with President Bashar Assad's government and has been accused of supporting its attacks against Syrians opposed to Assad's rule — something Moscow adamantly denies. Tillerson said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that Russians were not targeted by the strikes. He also said the top U.S. priority in the region hadn't changed and remained the defeat of Islamic State militants. Then he headed to Europe to gather with the foreign ministers of the other major industrialized nations before venturing on eastward to become the first Trump Cabinet member to visit Moscow — and possibly meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The criticism from the foreign policy establishment's left and right that has dogged Tillerson's tenure is dying down. Tillerson had faced questions about whether he understood that his new position meant he was now the face of the United States to the world, that he had to answer no longer to a small group of top shareholders but to more than 320 million Americans. The secretary of state must be \"the spokesman for American foreign policy,\" said Eliot Cohen, a senior State Department official during George W. Bush's presidency. \"This is the administration's first crisis but it won't be their last by a long shot, so he's going to have to get used to this.\" Joining Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, Tillerson was supposed to focus on the informal summit with Xi. Instead, he was thrust to the forefront after photos of the bodies piled in heaps in Idlib, Syria, dramatically altered the agenda. Only a week earlier, Tillerson had alarmed U.S. allies by indicating the U.S. was no longer interested in pushing for Assad's removal from power. In the hours leading up to Trump's decision to order the strikes, Tillerson was among the most forward-leaning of Trump's top aides in suggesting the U.S. would deliver an \"appropriate response.\" He challenged Russia publicly in a way Trump appeared scrupulously to avoid and said of Assad early Thursday: \"It would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people.\" After the cruise missiles crashed down in Syria, Tillerson was calm and commanding in a question-and-answer session with journalists. Cohen, a conservative critic of Trump's foreign policy who has chided Tillerson for his reticence, said he saw Tillerson growing into the job. \"I suspect you'll see more of him as he grows more comfortable in dealing with the press and in his relationship with the president and the administration's national security team,\" Cohen said. The challenge will be greater in Russia's capital this week. Tillerson is arriving at a fragile point in U.S.-Russia relations, where he will have to confront the Kremlin's anger over the missile strikes in Syria along with suspicion at home that Moscow may have been complicit in the Syrian government's chemical weapons attack. Senior U.S. military officials have said they are looking into whether Russia provided drone surveillance and helped Syrian forces try to cover up what they'd done. \"I think that there will be a lot of answers that come out of that meeting. And I think that's when the president will make his decisions,\" said Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, during an appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Beyond Syria are disputes over Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. At the same time, Tillerson carries to Moscow the weight of FBI and congressional investigations into Russia's interference in last year's presidential election. The Trump campaign's possible ties to the presumed Russian meddlers are also under scrutiny. \"This is going to be Tillerson's biggest test to date,\" said Julianne Smith, a National Security Council and Defense Department official under President Barack Obama. When he goes to Russia, keeping a low profile would likely be impossible, even if it were his goal. ___ Associated Press writers Josh Lederman and Julie Pace contributed to this report.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/1e8bda8a75104d02b4606c5c397af8bc/tillerson-steps-syria-russia-after-avoiding-spotlight\n\n\n\nTitle:\nNew report gives US airlines better grades across the board\nDescription:\nDALLAS (AP) — The airlines are getting better at sticking to their schedules and are losing fewer bags. Their customers seem to be complaining less often. Those are the findings of an annual report on airline quality being released Monday by researchers at Wichita State University and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The researchers use information compiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation to rate the airlines for on-time performance, baggage handling, bumping passengers off oversold flights, and complaints filed with the government. They planned to release their list of the best airlines later Monday. The report's general observations: — ON TIME PERFORMANCE: The percentage of flights that arrived on time or close enough rose to 81.4 percent in 2016 from 79.9 percent in 2015. Of 12 leading U.S. carriers, only American, JetBlue and Virgin America got worse. — LOST BAGS: The rate of bags being lost, stolen or delayed fell 17 percent. — BUMPING PASSENGERS: Your chances of getting bumped by the airline dropped 18 percent, which doesn't include people who voluntarily gave up their seat for money or a travel voucher. — FEWER COMPLAINTS: The rate of complaints filed with the government dropped about one-fifth, with complaints rising only for Hawaiian and Virgin America. The official complaint rates don't include the larger number of complaints that passengers file directly with the airline. The airlines are not required to report those figures. Clearly, however, airlines still have a perception problem. It's not hard to find passengers who complain about a miserable flight, a missed connection, or shabby treatment by airline employees. Comments like that abound on Twitter. \"People don't look at the numbers,\" said Dean Headley, a marketing professor at Wichita State and co-author of Monday's report. \"They just know what happened to them, or they hear what happened to other people.\" The Wichita State and Embry-Riddle researchers have been doing their report for more than 25 years, making it useful for comparing airlines. But some observers of the airline industry dismiss their number-crunching approach, and there are many other surveys that purport to rank the airlines. The Transportation Department counts a flight as being on time even if it arrives up to 14 minutes late. \"Airlines are happy with that (grace period) because it makes them look better and misleads the passenger,\" said aviation consultant Michael Baiada. He said airlines can do better, and besides, travelers pay to be on time — not 14 minutes late. More broadly, a statistical analysis of government data \"really doesn't take into consideration how the customer is treated,\" said Bryan Saltzburg, an executive with travel site TripAdvisor LLC. \"How comfortable are they on the plane? How helpful is the staff? What's the value for what the customer paid?\" TripAdvisor released its own airline rankings Monday, which it said were based on analysis of \"hundreds of thousands\" of reviews posted by users. It placed JetBlue and Alaska Airlines among the top 10 in the world, and it rated Delta ahead of American and United among the largest U.S. carriers. Other outfits including J.D. Power and Skytrax also put out ratings. Airlines boast when they win. Recently, American Airlines started putting stickers on all 968 of its planes to note that a trade publication, Air Transport World, named it airline of the year. ___ David Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/0c8396e963e14be69be4951d08cfb84e/new-report-gives-us-airlines-better-grades-across-board\n\n\n\nTitle:\nFord says hybrid police car catches bad guys, saves gas too\nDescription:\nDEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — The next time the cops chase you down for speeding, they could be driving a fuel-efficient gas-electric hybrid. Ford Motor Co., which sells more police cars in the U.S. than any other automaker, says it will offer a police pursuit version of the hybrid Fusion midsize sedan, in response to requests from cities nationwide. The new car, with its 2-Liter four-cylinder engine and 1.4 kilowatt lithium-ion battery, is expected to get 38 miles per gallon of gas in combined city-highway driving. That's 20 mpg more than Ford's current police car, the Taurus police interceptor. The hybrids won't be as fast as the Taurus with a 3.7-Liter turbocharged V6, but Ford expects it to be quick enough to earn a pursuit rating when tested later this year by the Michigan State Police and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the first hybrid to earn that honor. To get a pursuit rating, cars have to perform well in acceleration, handling, braking, top speed and ergonomics and make the list of cars that the Michigan and Los Angeles agencies would buy. When the throttle is held down for five seconds, the car will go into pursuit mode, using both the electric motor and the gas engine for maximum performance, Ford said. The company also says the car will be durable for tough police duties. Police cars spend much of their days idling by the side of a road, and that's where the hybrid has a true advantage, Ford said. The gas engine will shut off at idle with the battery handling the electrical load for flashers, radios and other items. It will restart to recharge the battery. Ford said at $2.50 per gallon for gas, the hybrid would save a police department $3,877 per year in fuel costs per vehicle. The price of the hybrid, available in the fall of 2018, isn't being released just yet. Ford was to unveil the police car Monday with press conferences in New York and Los Angeles. One already has been outfitted to look like a Los Angeles police cruiser. While big-city departments might be most interested in the fuel savings, the cars might also be appealing to small departments. Thomas Korabik, chief of the 10-officer North Muskegon, Michigan, Police Department, said his city spends about $22,000 per year on gasoline for four cruisers and would be interested in cutting that in half. But he wonders if the Fusion is big enough inside to carry computers, radios and other equipment. Many departments have switched to SUVs to handle the equipment, said Korabik, who also is president of the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police. \"Anytime you can save money it is good,\" he said. \"I'd want to see the car first and see how it would hold up.\" Todd Soderquist, Ford's chief engineer for the Fusion Police Responder, conceded the car is smaller than other cruisers on the outside. \"Internally, you'll be surprised at how comparable they are,\" he said.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/295bbfe0f9f64fbea758e0119311b891/ford-says-hybrid-police-car-catches-bad-guys-saves-gas-too\n\n\n\nTitle:\nHawaii LGBT couples seek equal access to fertility treatment\nDescription:\nHONOLULU (AP) — Sean Smith and his husband paid more than $20,000 for a fertility procedure when they decided to have a child using a surrogate mother. They did not know at the time that if they were a heterosexual couple, they might have saved that money. Now, Smith and other members of Hawaii's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community are lobbying for equal access to the financial help married, heterosexual couples enjoy under state law. They are pushing legislation that would require insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization for more couples, including making Hawaii the first state to require the coverage for surrogates, which would help male same-sex couples who must use a surrogate. \"Now that marriage equality is the law of the land and is accepted, now let's turn to family building, and let's figure out how we fix all these inequities that exist,\" said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of Resolve, a national organization that advocates for access to fertility treatments. Hawaii is one of eight states that require insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization, a costly procedure where a doctor retrieves eggs from a woman, combines them with sperm from a man and then implants an embryo into a woman's uterus. But Hawaii's mandate applies only to married heterosexual couples because it covers the medical intervention only if a woman uses sperm from her spouse, leaving the LGBT community and single women behind. \"At the end of the visit, I would be going into the office and pulling out my credit card, and other people are probably just walking out and insurance is picking up the tab,\" Smith said. \"We had to borrow money, refinance a second mortgage, and I'm sure there are people who don't even explore the option because the expenses are too great.\" The measure pending in the Hawaii Legislature removes requirements that the egg and sperm come from a married couple and includes surrogates among the people to be covered. No other state has included surrogates in their laws, Collura said. \"It is definitely groundbreaking,\" Collura said. \"And it's an often-overlooked way that people choose to build their family, and it should not be left out. It's great to see that Hawaii is taking the lead.\" Kaiser Permanente Hawaii opposed the measure, saying the medical provider and insurer does not perform in vitro fertilization with donor eggs or surrogates because of complex legal issues and medical risks. The company asked lawmakers to remove egg donors and surrogates from the bill, saying requiring coverage of additional procedures would raise costs for the company and its customers. A similar measure in Hawaii failed in previous legislative sessions. But aside from Kaiser, the bill has seen little opposition this year. A broad coalition including the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii, the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission and the Democratic Party of Hawaii are working with LGBT groups to push for change. The proposal passed the state Senate and is up for a vote in the House this week. Maryland had a law that also excluded same-sex couples until about a year ago, when the Legislature changed the provision so it no longer required using a husband's sperm. That helped lesbian couples, but gay men were still left out because the law didn't cover surrogates, Collura said. Most state mandates limit insurance reimbursement to a certain number of in vitro fertilization trials or allow coverage only after years of infertility. Some states also allow religious or small employers to get out of the requirement. \"We need to change these laws,\" Collura said. \"We need to update them and make them so that they are no longer discriminatory.\"\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/9c86d06eab8b49e3818597834d6571f8/hawaii-lgbt-couples-seek-equal-access-fertility-treatment\n\n\n\nTitle:\nNew York derailment highlights US infrastructure concerns\nDescription:\nWhen a train jumped the tracks this past week at New York's Penn Station, the seemingly minor accident led to a cascade of exasperating delays for hundreds of thousands of commuters. When a flood forced authorities to condemn a one-lane, century-old bridge in rural Ozark, Missouri, it was no less frustrating for the residents and business owners cut off from their shortest route into town. The two episodes highlight a reality about the U.S. transportation system — it is aging, congested and so vital that when things go wrong, big and costly disruptions can result for which there is no quick fix. Though President Donald Trump has promised a $1 trillion infrastructure-rebuilding program, not all of that may go toward transportation. Even then, it would fall well short of the many trillions needed to fix the country's web of roads, bridges, railways, subways and bus stations. The commuter train in New York derailed because of a weakened railroad tie. No one was seriously injured. But the incident shut down eight of the station's 21 tracks, disrupting Amtrak service in the Northeast from Boston to Washington, as well as delaying commuter trains in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for the better part of a week. Business meetings were canceled, ballgames, dinners and doctor's appointments missed, and commuters fumed. Lawyer Dominic Boone, who travels into New York from New Jersey, complained that because he arrived late to the office and had to leave early to catch a different train, he lost 10 hours of work for which he could have billed clients. \"They should have been working on Penn Station forever ago,\" Boone said. \"As a nation, we should be spending more on our crumbling infrastructure.\" The disruption was only a brief example of the frustration travelers could face if the region can't find a way to replace a pair of deteriorating, overcrowded, century-old rail tunnels that run under the Hudson River and connect New York and New Jersey. The tunnels, which were severely damaged in Superstorm Sandy in 2012, could cost more than $20 billion to replace. But the money has yet to be lined up. And construction, whenever it begins, may take more than a decade. The Penn Station derailment came less than two weeks after another one there, caused by a misaligned track. And it happened just days after motorists in Atlanta were forced to begin taking long, bumper-to-bumper detours because a fire collapsed an Interstate 85 overpass linking the city to some of its biggest suburbs. Arson — not aging steel and concrete — is suspected there. It could take until mid-June to repair the highway. Earlier this year, a cracked steel beam forced the closing of a major bridge between Pennsylvania and New Jersey for 1½ months. Improving the nation's roads and bridges would require $120 billion a year through 2020, according to a recent U.S. Department of Transportation estimate. But annual spending at all levels of government is just $88 billion. And the nation's mass transit systems have over a $90 billion backlog of maintenance and repair needs. The capacity of the nation's transportation system is lagging behind population growth, leading to ever greater congestion. By 2040, nearly 30,000 miles of the nation's busiest highways are expected to be clogged on a daily basis. Rural communities also face challenges, partly because they have fewer residents over whom to spread the cost of transportation improvements. Grant County, Oklahoma, for example, has more than 3,500 bridges with a population of about 4,500 and an economy based on agriculture and energy production. \"While this infrastructure was ideal 70 years ago for transporting livestock and crops, it is inadequate to support today's heavier trucks, increased traffic and higher operating needs,\" county commission chairwoman Cindy Bobbitt told U.S. senators at a recent hearing. The complexities of government can sometimes slow down improvements, as cities, counties, states, port authorities, special taxing districts and federal agencies all have a say in which projects get built, when to do the work and how to pay the bills. Plans for wider roads and new rail lines can also face opposition from the communities they pass through because of concerns about noise, pollution and diminished property values. \"Of course I believe there needs to be more\" infrastructure investment, said Martin Wachs, a retired professor of civil and environmental engineering and urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"At the same time, political decisions have to be made that weigh that against investments in education and health care and so forth.\" At least 20 states have raised taxes or fees for transportation over the past five years. California became the latest to do so Thursday, as legislators passed a bill to raise $5 billion annually through higher fuel taxes and vehicle fees to pay for road and bridge repairs, public transit and pedestrian trails. The plan tackles part of a $137 billion backlog of deferred maintenance on state highways and local roads. It came together after a destructive winter in which flooding caused nearly $600 million in damage to highways. Indiana and Tennessee are among other states considering raising fuel taxes and fees for transportation this year. In Ozark, a town of fewer than 20,000 people in Missouri, voters approved a transportation sales tax Tuesday of three-eighths of a cent, with some of the proceeds going toward a new, $3 million two-lane bridge to replace the narrow structure that has been closed since it was damaged by flooding in 2015. The bridge closing has forced 75-year-old Gary Jenks to drive an extra 10 minutes along a circuitous route every time he needs to go the doctor or pharmacy or visit his family on the opposite side of town. \"It's just been a total inconvenience and a burden,\" Jenks said. ___ Associated Press reporter Karen Matthews contributed from New York.

The U.S. women's national soccer team struck a new collective bargaining agreement with their federation, ending more than a year of at times contentious negotiations, with players seeking comparable compensation to the men's national team. It followed the U.S. national hockey team's deal with USA Hockey after players threatened to boycott the women's world championships over wages. The quest for better pay and conditions even extended across the Atlantic to Ireland, where the women's national soccer team there threatened to sit out of an exhibition match this week. \"It's pretty incredible what the women's hockey team did and they were courageous in their fight. There were differences between our battle and their battle, but they were inspirational,\" U.S. midfielder Megan Rapinoe said. \"For us and them, we were able to inspire other teams.\" The actions of these teams highlight the struggle for female athletes to achieve fair compensation for their efforts, even if that doesn't mean identical paychecks to their male counterparts. 'Fair' can include even simple items like access to changing rooms, in the case of the Irish players. It is not a new fight. Back in 1995, a group of high-profile players including Michelle Akers, Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm and Kristine Lilly were locked out of a pre-Olympic training camp because of a disagreement over bonus pay with the U.S. Soccer Federation. The dispute was quickly settled and women's soccer made its debut at the 1996 Atlanta Games. The United States won the gold. Following the team's victory on penalty kicks in the 1999 World Cup final against China, the players boycotted a tournament in Australia. They eventually came to terms on a deal with the federation that extended through the 2004 Athens Olympics. Inspired by the soccer players, Olympian Cammi Granato pushed USA Hockey in 2000 for better conditions and pay. The hockey team was coming off a gold-medal-winning run in the 1998 Nagano Games, the first Olympics that included the women's game as a sport. With the help John Langel, the same lawyer who helped the soccer team strike its deal, the players sent a letter to the federation outlining their concerns. Lacking leverage to move the effort forward, it failed and the issue was largely dropped — until this year. Langel also helped the team reach its current agreement before the world championships. This time, a social media hashtag, #BeBoldForChange, helped make the cause an international sensation. \"I think that this is just the beginning, and I think you're going to see more of this. We are reaching the next level of women's sports,\" said U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. \"At the beginning it was just allowing women to play, then it was making sure they got funded in the schools so they could play, and now we're reaching that biggest pinnacle, which is really getting them to the point where people are watching them as much as they watch men. And we're not quite there yet, but the only way we get there is by using examples like what just happened with hockey and moving it out into other sports.\" Ireland's national team, made up mostly of amateurs with day jobs, wasn't getting even basic financial support for things like compensation for time off from work while on international duty. Players said they'd been forced to dress in public restrooms and had to share team-branded apparel with the junior national teams. The women held a news conference decrying the conditions. It won the team public sympathy and helped force the Football Association of Ireland to work out an agreement with the women. Goalkeeper Emma Byrne posted to Twitter: \"Victory! Thank you for all your support. It proves unity is a powerful force.\" There have been other successes, too. The Australian women's national soccer team, capitalizing on the team's surprising play in the 2015 World Cup, boycotted friendlies in the United States and wound up negotiating a deal that got them better wages, bonuses and travel provisions. In tennis, Grand Slam events and many other tournaments give equal prize money to men and women. But lingering sexism flared up last year when Raymond Moore, director of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, made comments that outraged many and forced his resignation. \"In my next life when I come back I want to be someone in the WTA because they ride on the coattails of the men. They don't make any decisions and they are lucky. They are very, very lucky,\" Moore said at the time. The backlash showed that Moore's opinion was an outdated and tired trope. Women's sports are more popular than ever, thanks in part to Title IX, which spurred increased female participation at the college level. The internet has given fans greater access to the games and its stars. That's been coupled with some amazing performances by female athletes and teams in recent years: From Serena Williams' dominance on the tennis court to Carli Lloyd's hat trick in the 2015 Women's World Cup final to UConn's supremacy of college basketball. On Friday night, the U.S. women's hockey team capped an emotional two weeks with a thrilling 3-2 overtime win over Canada in the world championship final. \"If anything that we did can inspire anyone — sports, girls, boys, out of sports, whatever — to stand up for what they believe in, I think that's a huge plus,\" team captain Meghan Duggan said.

It quickly escalated into something more sinister. Soon a pig's head was buried in the ground at the future Nangang mosque, the culmination of a rally in which dozens of residents hoisted banners and circled the planned building site. Then the mosque's imam received a text message carrying a death threat: \"In case someone in your family dies, I have a coffin for you — and more than one, if necessary.\" \"How did things get stirred up to this point?\" the imam, Tao Yingsheng, said in a recent interview. \"Who had even heard of the Nangang mosque before?\" On the dusty plains of the Chinese heartland, a bitter fight over a mosque exemplifies how a surge in anti-Muslim sentiment online is spreading into communities across China, exacerbating simmering ethnic and religious tensions that have in the past erupted in bloodshed. It's also posing a dilemma for the ruling Communist Party, which has allowed Islamophobia to fester online for years as part of its campaign to justify security crackdowns in its restive region of Xinjiang. \"It's let the genie out of the bottle,\" said James Leibold, a professor at La Trobe University in Australia who has tracked the growth of anti-Muslim hate speech on China's internet. Interviews with residents and an examination of social media show how a few disparate online complaints by local homeowners evolved into a concerted campaign to spread hate. Key to it was an unexpected yet influential backer: a Chinese propaganda official, 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles) away in Xinjiang, whose inflammatory social media posts helped draw people into the streets on New Year's Day, resulting in a police crackdown. ___ A stone inscription outside its gate shows the original Nangang mosque was established in the 1780s by members of the Hui minority, the descendants of Silk Road traders who settled across China centuries ago. In its present form, the mosque has served the area's 4,500 Hui for decades, its domed silhouette partially hidden by overgrown shrubs in the countryside beyond Hefei's last paved boulevards. Over the past 10 years urbanization has come to Hefei, with sprawling development reconfiguring the landscape and its demographic flavor, and Hui leaders had been pushing for years to relocate their mosque to a more convenient urban location. City planners in November finally selected a site adjacent to the newly built Hangkong New City condominiums, with its $200,000 two-bedroom units, faux-Mediterranean stylings and a Volvo dealership across the street. The project's homeowners overwhelmingly members of China's ethnic Han majority began complaining on China's popular microblog, Weibo. Some complained the mosque would occupy space promised for a park. Others warned that safety in the area would be compromised. Others were more blunt: Han residents were uncomfortable that a center for Hui community life would be less than 100 meters (300 feet) from their building, a homeowner who later identified himself in messages to the AP by his surname, Cheng, wrote in a petition posted in December. \"And the less said about what happens on Eid al-Adha, the better,\" Cheng wrote, referring to the Islamic holiday in which animals are slaughtered for a sacrificial feast. \"It's absolutely shocking.\" The story soon caught the attention of Cui Zijian, a boyish-looking propaganda official in Xinjiang who writes about the threat of religious extremism on his Weibo account with nearly 30,000 followers. On Dec. 16, Cui suggested homeowners lobby local officials to block the construction, adding: \"If that doesn't work, then how about pig head, pig blood.\" Cui followed that a few hours later with another post repeating the four Chinese characters for pig blood and pig head over and over, attracting hundreds of reposts. While Cui was criticized by some on Weibo, a larger number — including at least one other government propaganda official — took his post as their cue to hurl abuse at the Hui. ___ The mosque dispute was just the latest flashpoint for an increasingly active anti-Muslim social media movement in China. A video of a Hui girl reciting the Quran in Arabic sparked outrage last May over so-called terrorist infiltration of Chinese schools, prompting officials to announce a \"strict ban\" on religion on campuses. Online activists derailed a Hui official's effort to regulate the halal food industry, arguing that religion was creeping into the officially atheistic Chinese state. Han Chinese, who make up 95 percent of the population, have long grumbled about the dozens of China's officially recognized minority groups receiving advantages on the hyper-competitive college entrance exams or exemptions from family-size limits, but online abuse has increasingly targeted Muslims. The rise in Islamophobia comes as Chinese have been buffeted by news of militant attacks in Europe, while at home, violence in Xinjiang and elsewhere has been blamed on Muslim separatists. Beijing has responded to the bloody, years-long insurgency from Muslim Uighur minorities in Xinjiang with further restrictions on Islamic expression, a move rights groups warn could potentially radicalize moderate Muslims. Such policies have also drawn vows of retaliation from the Islamic State and al-Qaeda. Ethnic hostility can only deepen, scholars say, when the government stops discussion of the plight of Muslims or ethnic policies while allowing anti-Muslim rhetoric and hate speech to go unchecked. In 2014, Uighur scholar Ilham Tohti, who had founded a website to host debates about ethnic tensions in Xinjiang, was sentenced to life in prison on separatism charges. Government censors go after descriptions of abuses against Muslims, but \"it doesn't take long whatsoever to find incredibly Islamophobic things that seem to be not censored at all,\" said William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International, which has appealed for Tohti's release. Political observers say the recent rise of a faction within the Communist Party advocating for a hard-line approach on religious affairs has coincided with the rise of government-linked commentators who openly warn about the danger of Islam. \"Interest groups have actively promoted Islamophobia in interior regions in order to create a nationwide environment that justifies Xinjiang's anti-terrorism campaign,\" said Ma Haiyun, a history professor specializing in China's Muslims at Frostburg State University in Maryland. \"There's an Islamophobic movement that aims at creating chaos and even conflicts at the local level.\" After briefly moderating his remarks about the Nangang mosque, the propaganda official, Cui, renewed his criticism in February with an essay arguing that his professional and patriotic duty was to resist extremism. His online speech about Muslims was part of the job, he said. \"For that, we're labeled Muslim-smearers,\" wrote Cui, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment. \"But it is those who instigate a fear of Islam, precisely the terrorists and the extremists, who are the ones smearing Muslims.\" Reached in March, an official at the propaganda department where he worked refused to comment on Cui's involvement in the controversy. But Cui now appears to be even better positioned to influence discourse: The official said Cui was transferred in February to work in the cyberspace administration, the agency in charge of censoring online speech. ___ Tao, the 50-year old imam, recalled the day in December when he heard his mosque was suddenly the subject of thousands of posts and hundreds of comments on Weibo, a service he barely used. He soon found himself soothing local Hui who approached him, shaken by what they were seeing online. \"They said people were planning to hang a pig's head outside our mosque. I said, 'Then we'll remove it.' They said people will bury a pig's head in the ground. I said 'Why can't we just dig it up?'\" Tao said. After protesters followed through with the threat at the New Year's Day demonstration, police detained two protest leaders for two weeks and summoned others for questioning, according to residents. Since then Han indignation has gave way to quiet seething. \"People have been scared into silence,\" said Cheng, the Han tea seller. During a recent visit to Hangkong New City, homeowners repeated the government's mantra that ethnic unity was important, but complained that officials sacrificed their interests to appease a minority. \"If 99 percent of our compound is Han, it doesn't seem appropriate that they put a mosque next door,\" said a middle-aged woman who said her surname was Han. Ma Jianhua, a Nangang district planning official, told the AP that construction will proceed after his office \"appropriately handled\" homeowners' petitions, but declined to elaborate. The mosque dispute has left the city's Hui community on the defensive, with many eager to emphasize their desire to peacefully coexist with their Han neighbors as well as their confidence in the government's handling of the situation. At a ranch past the undulating rapeseed field that separates the condos from rubble-strewn Huimin Lu — Hui People's Road — workers at what is one of the few Hui businesses that hasn't been demolished to make way for high-rises expressed surprise about the mosque dispute, given the area's history of ethnic mingling. \"We've been in these parts a long time,\" a worker surnamed Tao, who is not related to the imam, said as he loaded sacks of dried fatty beef. \"We mind our business and they mind theirs. We don't stir up trouble and they don't either.\" But Tao, the imam, seemed to acknowledge a hardening of attitudes toward Muslims in recent years. \"It may be that the situation has grown more sensitive in that place that we all know about,\" he said after a pause, referring to but not daring to mention Xinjiang. Still he tries to not harbor resentment toward the Han protesters. \"I don't blame the locals because I believe they were influenced,\" he said, sitting below framed pictures of him greeting government religious affairs officials. \"I want them to know Muslims are virtuous people. We are peaceful. We are reasonable. We are tolerant. And we are good Chinese.\"\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/e3711d789c8d48589b77f6e269d424fa/unfettered-online-hate-speech-fuels-islamophobia-china\n\n\n\nTitle:\nTrump advisers: US seeks to fight IS and oust Syria&#039;s Assad\nDescription:\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's national security adviser on Sunday left open the possibility of additional U.S. military action against Syria following last week's missile strike but indicated that the United States was not seeking to act unilaterally to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad. In his first televised interview, H.R. McMaster pointed to dual U.S. goals of defeating the Islamic State group and removing Assad. But he suggested that Trump was seeking a global political response for regime change from U.S. allies as well as Russia, which he said needed to re-evaluate its support of Syria. \"It's very difficult to understand how a political solution could result from the continuation of the Assad regime,\" McMaster said. \"Now, we are not saying that we are the ones who are going to effect that change. What we are saying is, other countries have to ask themselves some hard questions. Russia should ask themselves ...Why are we supporting this murderous regime that is committing mass murder of its own population?\" After last Tuesday's chemical attack in Syria, Trump said his attitude toward Assad \"has changed very much\" and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said \"steps are underway\" to organize a coalition to remove him from power. But as lawmakers called on Trump to consult with Congress on any future military strikes and a longer-term strategy on Syria, Trump administration officials sent mixed signals on the scope of U.S. involvement. While Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, described regime change in Syria as a U.S. priority and inevitable, Tillerson suggested that last week's American airstrikes in retaliation for the chemical attack hadn't really changed U.S. priorities toward ousting Assad. Pressed to clarify, McMaster said the goals of fighting IS and ousting Syria's president were somewhat \"simultaneous\" and that the objective of the missile strike was to send a \"strong political message to Assad.\" He did not rule out additional strikes if Assad continued to engage in atrocities against rebel forces with either chemical or conventional weapons. \"We are prepared to do more,\" he said. \"The president will make whatever decision he thinks is in the best interest of the American people.\" Reluctant to put significant troops on the ground in Syria, the U.S. for years has struggled to prevent Assad from strengthening his hold on power. U.S.-backed rebels groups have long pleaded for more U.S. intervention and complained that Washington has only fought the Islamic State group. So Trump's decision to launch the strikes — which President Barack Obama declined to do after a 2013 chemical attack — has raised optimism among rebels that Trump will more directly confront Assad. Several lawmakers said Sunday that decision shouldn't entirely be up to Trump. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the no. 2 Republican in the Senate, praised Trump's initial missile strike for sending a message to Assad, Russia, Iran and North Korea that \"there's a new administration in charge.\" But he said Trump now needed to work with Congress to set a future course. \"Congress needs to work with the president to try and deal with this long-term strategy, lack of strategy, really, in Syria,\" he said. \"We haven't had one for six years during the Obama administration, and 400,000 civilians have died and millions of people have been displaced internally and externally in Europe and elsewhere.\" Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, agreed. \"What we saw was a reaction to the use of chemical weapons, something I think many of us supported,\" he said. \"But what we did not see is a coherent policy on how we're going to deal with the civil war and also deal with ISIS.\" Still, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he believed that Trump didn't need to consult with Congress. \"I think the president has authorization to use force,\" he said. \"Assad signed the chemical weapons treaty ban. There's an agreement with him not to use chemical weapons.\" Their comments came as Tillerson was making the Trump administration's first official trip this week to Russia, a staunch Assad ally. In interviews broadcast Sunday, Tillerson said defeating the Islamic State group remains the top focus. Once that threat \"has been reduced or eliminated, I think we can turn our attention directly to stabilizing the situation in Syria,\" he said. \"We're hopeful that we can prevent a continuation of the civil war and that we can bring the parties to the table to begin the process of political discussions\" between the Assad government and various rebel groups. The hope, he said, is that \"we can navigate a political outcome in which the Syrian people, in fact, will determine Bashar al-Assad's fate and his legitimacy.\" Haley said \"getting Assad out is not the only priority\" and that countering Iran's influence in Syria was another. Still, Haley said the U.S. didn't see a peaceful future Syria with Assad in power. McMaster, Cornyn and Cardin spoke on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Tillerson appeared on ABC's \"This Week\" and CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Haley and Graham were on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and Haley also appeared on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" ___ Associated Press writer Josh Lederman contributed to this report.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/6d9da3ee01df44829a7878bad18998c2/trump-officials-say-no-new-us-focus-ousting-syrias-assad\n\n\n\nTitle:\nSuicide bombers kill 44 at Palm Sunday services in Egypt\nDescription:\nTANTA, Egypt (AP) — Suicide bombers struck hours apart at two Coptic churches in northern Egypt, killing 44 people and turning Palm Sunday services into scenes of horror and outrage at the government that led the president to call for a three-month state of emergency. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the violence, adding to fears that extremists are shifting their focus to civilians, especially Egypt's Christian minority. The attacks in the northern cities of Tanta and Alexandria that also left 126 people wounded came at the start of Holy Week leading up to Easter, and just weeks before Pope Francis is due to visit. Pope Tawadros II, the leader of the Coptic church who will meet with Francis on April 28-29, was in the Alexandra cathedral at the time of the bombing but was unhurt, the Interior Ministry said. It was the single deadliest day for Christians in decades and the worst since a bombing at a Cairo church in December killed 30 people. Late Sunday night, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi called for a three-month state of emergency. According to Egypt's constitution, parliament must vote in favor of such a declaration — a virtual certainty since it is packed with supporters of the president. It cannot exceed six months without a referendum to extend it. The army chief-turned-president also dispatched elite troops across the country to protect key installations and accused unidentified countries of fueling instability, saying that \"Egyptians have foiled plots and efforts by countries and fascist, terrorist organizations that tried to control Egypt.\" The attacks highlighted the difficulties facing el-Sissi's government in protecting Christians, who make up about 10 percent of Egypt's population. \"Where is the government?\" screamed an angry Maged Saleh, who rushed to the church in the Nile Delta city of Tanta where his mother escaped the carnage. \"There is no government!\" The first bomb exploded inside St. George's Church in Tanta, killing at least 27 people and wounding 78, officials said, overturning pews, shattering windows and staining the whitewashed walls with blood. Video from inside the church broadcast by CBC TV showed people gathered around what appeared to be lifeless, bloody bodies covered with papers. Several doors had been blown off. Women wailed outside. \"After the explosion, everything became dark from the smoke,\" said Edmond Edward, attending Mass with his brother, Emil, who suffered head wounds and leaned on him for support at a nearby hospital. \"There was a clear lapse in security, which must be tightened from now on to save lives,\" he told The Associated Press. The blast appeared to be centered near the altar, he said. Susan Mikhail, whose apartment balcony across the street has a clear view of the church and its front yard, said the explosion violently shook her building. \"Deacons were the first to run out of the church. Many of them had blood on their white robes,\" she told the AP. The more seriously wounded then were carried out by other survivors and taken to hospitals in private cars, she said. Hundreds of residents gathered in the area, and church members blocked people from entering the church as police cordoned off the area. A few hours later, a suicide bomber rushed toward St. Mark's Cathedral in the coastal city of Alexandria, the historic seat of Christendom in Egypt, killing at least 17 people and wounding 48. CCTV images showed a man with a blue sweater tied over his shoulders approaching the main gate to St. Mark's and then being turned away by security and directed toward a metal detector. He passed a female police officer talking to another woman, and entered a metal detector before an explosion engulfed the area. The Health Ministry said six Muslims were among the dead in Alexandria. Pope Tawadros II had held Palm Sunday services at the cathedral and the timing of the attack indicated the bomber had sought to assassinate him. Pope Francis marked Palm Sunday in St. Peter's Square by expressing \"deep condolences to my brother, Pope Tawadros II, the Coptic church and all of the dear Egyptian nation.\" Magdy George Youssef, a deacon at St. George's, said the church was almost full when the blast occurred and threw him under a pew. \"All I could think of was to find my wife, and all I could see was smoke, blood and completely charred bodies,\" the distraught 58-year-old said. Youssef, who suffered only an injured ear, later found his wife at home, with burns to her face. IS said in a statement that two Egyptian suicide bombers named Abu Ishaq al Masri and Abu al Baraa al Masri carried out the church attacks and vowed to continue attacks against Christians. \"What happened is a dangerous indicator that shows how easy it is to attack a large gathering of people in different places,\" said researcher Ishaq Ibrahim with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. \"There is a complete government failure in taking the IS threat seriously.\" El-Sissi said in a statement that Sunday's attacks would only strengthen the resolve of Egyptians against \"evil forces.\" He held an emergency meeting of the National Defense Council, which includes the prime minister, the defense and interior ministers, the speaker of parliament and top army commanders and security chiefs. Regional police chief Brig. Gen. Hossam Elddin Khalifa was fired over the Tanta bombing, with Maj. Gen. Tarek Hassouna replacing him, state-run newspaper al-Ahram reported. President Donald Trump tweeted that he is \"so sad to hear of the terrorist attack\" against the U.S. ally but added that he has \"great confidence\" that el-Sissi \"will handle the situation properly.\" The two leaders met at the White House on April 3. Grand Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, head of Egypt's Al-Azhar — the leading center of learning in Sunni Islam — also condemned the attacks, calling them a \"despicable terrorist bombing that targeted the lives of innocents.\" Both Israel and the Islamic Hamas movement ruling neighboring Gaza condemned the bombings as well. An Islamic State affiliate claimed the December bombing as well as a string of killings in the northern Sinai that forced hundreds of Christians to flee to safer areas. The militants recently vowed to step up attacks against Christians, whom they regard as infidels. Egypt has struggled to combat a wave of Islamic militancy since the 2013 military overthrow of an elected Islamist president. The Sinai-based IS affiliate has mainly attacked police and soldiers, but has also claimed bombings including the downing of a Russian passenger jetliner in the Sinai in 2015, which killed all 224 people aboard and devastated Egypt's tourism industry. Egypt's Copts are one of the oldest Christian communities in the Middle East and have long complained of discrimination and that the government does not do enough to protect them. Security at churches is routinely increased around religious holidays. The Copts largely supported the military overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, and incurred the wrath of many of his followers, who attacked churches and other Christian institutions. While the Copts have stood steadfast alongside the government, an increase in attacks on Christians has tested that support. Egyptian media had previously reported that the church in Tanta had been targeted before, with a bomb defused there in late March. As night fell, hundreds of Christians, mostly clad in black, streamed to the church to offer their condolences. Scuffles broke out between the mourners and church volunteers guarding the church's doors as many pushed and shoved to get in. ___ Associated Press writers Maggie Michael, Brian Rohan, Menna Zaki and Maamoun Youssef in Cairo and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed to this report.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/88b8fef3a96e433c902a303cd5db928e/egypt-state-media-bombing-church-nile-delta\n\n\n\nTitle:\nTillerson&#039;s Russia trip highlights emergence from shadows\nDescription:\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Criticized for his low-profile diplomacy, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is emerging from the shadows with a leading public role in shaping and explaining the Trump administration's missile strikes in Syria. And, he's set for an even higher-profile mission, heading to Moscow under the twin clouds of Russia's U.S. election meddling and its possible support for a Syrian chemical weapons attack. Since taking office in February, the former Exxon Mobil CEO has admittedly shunned the spotlight and the press. Yet, Tillerson was surprisingly visible during last week's announcement of the response to the gruesome chemical attack, fielding questions from reporters on and off camera, and then captured in an official White House photo seated next to President Donald Trump as they heard the result of the 59 cruise missiles that struck a Syrian military base. Tillerson was a prominent fixture during the most important foreign policy period in Trump's young presidency: a two-day summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping that coincided with the strikes against Syria. He was by Trump's side during his meetings with Xi and spoke publicly multiple times to address both issues. It was Tillerson who delivered the Trump administration's first blistering condemnation of Russia in the hours after the strikes. Standing in a cramped conference room alongside national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Tillerson said Moscow had \"failed\" to live up to its obligations under a 2013 agreement to strip Syria of its chemical weapons stockpiles. \"Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has simply been incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement,\" he said. On Sunday, he made his first network television interview appearances. In one interview, Tillerson said he sees no reason for retaliation from Russia for the U.S. missile strikes. Russia maintains a close political and military alliance with President Bashar Assad's government and has been accused of supporting its attacks against Syrians opposed to Assad's rule — something Moscow adamantly denies. Tillerson said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that Russians were not targeted by the strikes. He also said the top U.S. priority in the region hadn't changed and remained the defeat of Islamic State militants. Then he headed to Europe to gather with the foreign ministers of the other major industrialized nations before venturing on eastward to become the first Trump Cabinet member to visit Moscow — and possibly meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The criticism from the foreign policy establishment's left and right that has dogged Tillerson's tenure is dying down. Tillerson had faced questions about whether he understood that his new position meant he was now the face of the United States to the world, that he had to answer no longer to a small group of top shareholders but to more than 320 million Americans. The secretary of state must be \"the spokesman for American foreign policy,\" said Eliot Cohen, a senior State Department official during George W. Bush's presidency. \"This is the administration's first crisis but it won't be their last by a long shot, so he's going to have to get used to this.\" Joining Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, Tillerson was supposed to focus on the informal summit with Xi. Instead, he was thrust to the forefront after photos of the bodies piled in heaps in Idlib, Syria, dramatically altered the agenda. Only a week earlier, Tillerson had alarmed U.S. allies by indicating the U.S. was no longer interested in pushing for Assad's removal from power. In the hours leading up to Trump's decision to order the strikes, Tillerson was among the most forward-leaning of Trump's top aides in suggesting the U.S. would deliver an \"appropriate response.\" He challenged Russia publicly in a way Trump appeared scrupulously to avoid and said of Assad early Thursday: \"It would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people.\" After the cruise missiles crashed down in Syria, Tillerson was calm and commanding in a question-and-answer session with journalists. Cohen, a conservative critic of Trump's foreign policy who has chided Tillerson for his reticence, said he saw Tillerson growing into the job. \"I suspect you'll see more of him as he grows more comfortable in dealing with the press and in his relationship with the president and the administration's national security team,\" Cohen said. The challenge will be greater in Russia's capital this week. Tillerson is arriving at a fragile point in U.S.-Russia relations, where he will have to confront the Kremlin's anger over the missile strikes in Syria along with suspicion at home that Moscow may have been complicit in the Syrian government's chemical weapons attack. Senior U.S. military officials have said they are looking into whether Russia provided drone surveillance and helped Syrian forces try to cover up what they'd done. \"I think that there will be a lot of answers that come out of that meeting. And I think that's when the president will make his decisions,\" said Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, during an appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Beyond Syria are disputes over Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. At the same time, Tillerson carries to Moscow the weight of FBI and congressional investigations into Russia's interference in last year's presidential election. The Trump campaign's possible ties to the presumed Russian meddlers are also under scrutiny. \"This is going to be Tillerson's biggest test to date,\" said Julianne Smith, a National Security Council and Defense Department official under President Barack Obama. When he goes to Russia, keeping a low profile would likely be impossible, even if it were his goal. ___ Associated Press writers Josh Lederman and Julie Pace contributed to this report.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/1e8bda8a75104d02b4606c5c397af8bc/tillerson-steps-syria-russia-after-avoiding-spotlight\n\n\n\nTitle:\nNew report gives US airlines better grades across the board\nDescription:\nDALLAS (AP) — The airlines are getting better at sticking to their schedules and are losing fewer bags. Their customers seem to be complaining less often. Those are the findings of an annual report on airline quality being released Monday by researchers at Wichita State University and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The researchers use information compiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation to rate the airlines for on-time performance, baggage handling, bumping passengers off oversold flights, and complaints filed with the government. They planned to release their list of the best airlines later Monday. The report's general observations: — ON TIME PERFORMANCE: The percentage of flights that arrived on time or close enough rose to 81.4 percent in 2016 from 79.9 percent in 2015. Of 12 leading U.S. carriers, only American, JetBlue and Virgin America got worse. — LOST BAGS: The rate of bags being lost, stolen or delayed fell 17 percent. — BUMPING PASSENGERS: Your chances of getting bumped by the airline dropped 18 percent, which doesn't include people who voluntarily gave up their seat for money or a travel voucher. — FEWER COMPLAINTS: The rate of complaints filed with the government dropped about one-fifth, with complaints rising only for Hawaiian and Virgin America. The official complaint rates don't include the larger number of complaints that passengers file directly with the airline. The airlines are not required to report those figures. Clearly, however, airlines still have a perception problem. It's not hard to find passengers who complain about a miserable flight, a missed connection, or shabby treatment by airline employees. Comments like that abound on Twitter. \"People don't look at the numbers,\" said Dean Headley, a marketing professor at Wichita State and co-author of Monday's report. \"They just know what happened to them, or they hear what happened to other people.\" The Wichita State and Embry-Riddle researchers have been doing their report for more than 25 years, making it useful for comparing airlines. But some observers of the airline industry dismiss their number-crunching approach, and there are many other surveys that purport to rank the airlines. The Transportation Department counts a flight as being on time even if it arrives up to 14 minutes late. \"Airlines are happy with that (grace period) because it makes them look better and misleads the passenger,\" said aviation consultant Michael Baiada. He said airlines can do better, and besides, travelers pay to be on time — not 14 minutes late. More broadly, a statistical analysis of government data \"really doesn't take into consideration how the customer is treated,\" said Bryan Saltzburg, an executive with travel site TripAdvisor LLC. \"How comfortable are they on the plane? How helpful is the staff? What's the value for what the customer paid?\" TripAdvisor released its own airline rankings Monday, which it said were based on analysis of \"hundreds of thousands\" of reviews posted by users. It placed JetBlue and Alaska Airlines among the top 10 in the world, and it rated Delta ahead of American and United among the largest U.S. carriers. Other outfits including J.D. Power and Skytrax also put out ratings. Airlines boast when they win. Recently, American Airlines started putting stickers on all 968 of its planes to note that a trade publication, Air Transport World, named it airline of the year. ___ David Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/0c8396e963e14be69be4951d08cfb84e/new-report-gives-us-airlines-better-grades-across-board\n\n\n\nTitle:\nFord says hybrid police car catches bad guys, saves gas too\nDescription:\nDEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — The next time the cops chase you down for speeding, they could be driving a fuel-efficient gas-electric hybrid. Ford Motor Co., which sells more police cars in the U.S. than any other automaker, says it will offer a police pursuit version of the hybrid Fusion midsize sedan, in response to requests from cities nationwide. The new car, with its 2-Liter four-cylinder engine and 1.4 kilowatt lithium-ion battery, is expected to get 38 miles per gallon of gas in combined city-highway driving. That's 20 mpg more than Ford's current police car, the Taurus police interceptor. The hybrids won't be as fast as the Taurus with a 3.7-Liter turbocharged V6, but Ford expects it to be quick enough to earn a pursuit rating when tested later this year by the Michigan State Police and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the first hybrid to earn that honor. To get a pursuit rating, cars have to perform well in acceleration, handling, braking, top speed and ergonomics and make the list of cars that the Michigan and Los Angeles agencies would buy. When the throttle is held down for five seconds, the car will go into pursuit mode, using both the electric motor and the gas engine for maximum performance, Ford said. The company also says the car will be durable for tough police duties. Police cars spend much of their days idling by the side of a road, and that's where the hybrid has a true advantage, Ford said. The gas engine will shut off at idle with the battery handling the electrical load for flashers, radios and other items. It will restart to recharge the battery. Ford said at $2.50 per gallon for gas, the hybrid would save a police department $3,877 per year in fuel costs per vehicle. The price of the hybrid, available in the fall of 2018, isn't being released just yet. Ford was to unveil the police car Monday with press conferences in New York and Los Angeles. One already has been outfitted to look like a Los Angeles police cruiser. While big-city departments might be most interested in the fuel savings, the cars might also be appealing to small departments. Thomas Korabik, chief of the 10-officer North Muskegon, Michigan, Police Department, said his city spends about $22,000 per year on gasoline for four cruisers and would be interested in cutting that in half. But he wonders if the Fusion is big enough inside to carry computers, radios and other equipment. Many departments have switched to SUVs to handle the equipment, said Korabik, who also is president of the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police. \"Anytime you can save money it is good,\" he said. \"I'd want to see the car first and see how it would hold up.\" Todd Soderquist, Ford's chief engineer for the Fusion Police Responder, conceded the car is smaller than other cruisers on the outside. \"Internally, you'll be surprised at how comparable they are,\" he said.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/295bbfe0f9f64fbea758e0119311b891/ford-says-hybrid-police-car-catches-bad-guys-saves-gas-too\n\n\n\nTitle:\nHawaii LGBT couples seek equal access to fertility treatment\nDescription:\nHONOLULU (AP) — Sean Smith and his husband paid more than $20,000 for a fertility procedure when they decided to have a child using a surrogate mother. They did not know at the time that if they were a heterosexual couple, they might have saved that money. Now, Smith and other members of Hawaii's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community are lobbying for equal access to the financial help married, heterosexual couples enjoy under state law. They are pushing legislation that would require insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization for more couples, including making Hawaii the first state to require the coverage for surrogates, which would help male same-sex couples who must use a surrogate. \"Now that marriage equality is the law of the land and is accepted, now let's turn to family building, and let's figure out how we fix all these inequities that exist,\" said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of Resolve, a national organization that advocates for access to fertility treatments. Hawaii is one of eight states that require insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization, a costly procedure where a doctor retrieves eggs from a woman, combines them with sperm from a man and then implants an embryo into a woman's uterus. But Hawaii's mandate applies only to married heterosexual couples because it covers the medical intervention only if a woman uses sperm from her spouse, leaving the LGBT community and single women behind. \"At the end of the visit, I would be going into the office and pulling out my credit card, and other people are probably just walking out and insurance is picking up the tab,\" Smith said. \"We had to borrow money, refinance a second mortgage, and I'm sure there are people who don't even explore the option because the expenses are too great.\" The measure pending in the Hawaii Legislature removes requirements that the egg and sperm come from a married couple and includes surrogates among the people to be covered. No other state has included surrogates in their laws, Collura said. \"It is definitely groundbreaking,\" Collura said. \"And it's an often-overlooked way that people choose to build their family, and it should not be left out. It's great to see that Hawaii is taking the lead.\" Kaiser Permanente Hawaii opposed the measure, saying the medical provider and insurer does not perform in vitro fertilization with donor eggs or surrogates because of complex legal issues and medical risks. The company asked lawmakers to remove egg donors and surrogates from the bill, saying requiring coverage of additional procedures would raise costs for the company and its customers. A similar measure in Hawaii failed in previous legislative sessions. But aside from Kaiser, the bill has seen little opposition this year. A broad coalition including the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii, the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission and the Democratic Party of Hawaii are working with LGBT groups to push for change. The proposal passed the state Senate and is up for a vote in the House this week. Maryland had a law that also excluded same-sex couples until about a year ago, when the Legislature changed the provision so it no longer required using a husband's sperm. That helped lesbian couples, but gay men were still left out because the law didn't cover surrogates, Collura said. Most state mandates limit insurance reimbursement to a certain number of in vitro fertilization trials or allow coverage only after years of infertility. Some states also allow religious or small employers to get out of the requirement. \"We need to change these laws,\" Collura said. \"We need to update them and make them so that they are no longer discriminatory.\"\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/9c86d06eab8b49e3818597834d6571f8/hawaii-lgbt-couples-seek-equal-access-fertility-treatment\n\n\n\nTitle:\nNew York derailment highlights US infrastructure concerns\nDescription:\nWhen a train jumped the tracks this past week at New York's Penn Station, the seemingly minor accident led to a cascade of exasperating delays for hundreds of thousands of commuters. When a flood forced authorities to condemn a one-lane, century-old bridge in rural Ozark, Missouri, it was no less frustrating for the residents and business owners cut off from their shortest route into town. The two episodes highlight a reality about the U.S. transportation system — it is aging, congested and so vital that when things go wrong, big and costly disruptions can result for which there is no quick fix. Though President Donald Trump has promised a $1 trillion infrastructure-rebuilding program, not all of that may go toward transportation. Even then, it would fall well short of the many trillions needed to fix the country's web of roads, bridges, railways, subways and bus stations. The commuter train in New York derailed because of a weakened railroad tie. No one was seriously injured. But the incident shut down eight of the station's 21 tracks, disrupting Amtrak service in the Northeast from Boston to Washington, as well as delaying commuter trains in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for the better part of a week. Business meetings were canceled, ballgames, dinners and doctor's appointments missed, and commuters fumed. Lawyer Dominic Boone, who travels into New York from New Jersey, complained that because he arrived late to the office and had to leave early to catch a different train, he lost 10 hours of work for which he could have billed clients. \"They should have been working on Penn Station forever ago,\" Boone said. \"As a nation, we should be spending more on our crumbling infrastructure.\" The disruption was only a brief example of the frustration travelers could face if the region can't find a way to replace a pair of deteriorating, overcrowded, century-old rail tunnels that run under the Hudson River and connect New York and New Jersey. The tunnels, which were severely damaged in Superstorm Sandy in 2012, could cost more than $20 billion to replace. But the money has yet to be lined up. And construction, whenever it begins, may take more than a decade. The Penn Station derailment came less than two weeks after another one there, caused by a misaligned track. And it happened just days after motorists in Atlanta were forced to begin taking long, bumper-to-bumper detours because a fire collapsed an Interstate 85 overpass linking the city to some of its biggest suburbs. Arson — not aging steel and concrete — is suspected there. It could take until mid-June to repair the highway. Earlier this year, a cracked steel beam forced the closing of a major bridge between Pennsylvania and New Jersey for 1½ months. Improving the nation's roads and bridges would require $120 billion a year through 2020, according to a recent U.S. Department of Transportation estimate. But annual spending at all levels of government is just $88 billion. And the nation's mass transit systems have over a $90 billion backlog of maintenance and repair needs. The capacity of the nation's transportation system is lagging behind population growth, leading to ever greater congestion. By 2040, nearly 30,000 miles of the nation's busiest highways are expected to be clogged on a daily basis. Rural communities also face challenges, partly because they have fewer residents over whom to spread the cost of transportation improvements. Grant County, Oklahoma, for example, has more than 3,500 bridges with a population of about 4,500 and an economy based on agriculture and energy production. \"While this infrastructure was ideal 70 years ago for transporting livestock and crops, it is inadequate to support today's heavier trucks, increased traffic and higher operating needs,\" county commission chairwoman Cindy Bobbitt told U.S. senators at a recent hearing. The complexities of government can sometimes slow down improvements, as cities, counties, states, port authorities, special taxing districts and federal agencies all have a say in which projects get built, when to do the work and how to pay the bills. Plans for wider roads and new rail lines can also face opposition from the communities they pass through because of concerns about noise, pollution and diminished property values. \"Of course I believe there needs to be more\" infrastructure investment, said Martin Wachs, a retired professor of civil and environmental engineering and urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"At the same time, political decisions have to be made that weigh that against investments in education and health care and so forth.\" At least 20 states have raised taxes or fees for transportation over the past five years. California became the latest to do so Thursday, as legislators passed a bill to raise $5 billion annually through higher fuel taxes and vehicle fees to pay for road and bridge repairs, public transit and pedestrian trails. The plan tackles part of a $137 billion backlog of deferred maintenance on state highways and local roads. It came together after a destructive winter in which flooding caused nearly $600 million in damage to highways. Indiana and Tennessee are among other states considering raising fuel taxes and fees for transportation this year. In Ozark, a town of fewer than 20,000 people in Missouri, voters approved a transportation sales tax Tuesday of three-eighths of a cent, with some of the proceeds going toward a new, $3 million two-lane bridge to replace the narrow structure that has been closed since it was damaged by flooding in 2015. The bridge closing has forced 75-year-old Gary Jenks to drive an extra 10 minutes along a circuitous route every time he needs to go the doctor or pharmacy or visit his family on the opposite side of town. \"It's just been a total inconvenience and a burden,\" Jenks said. ___ Associated Press reporter Karen Matthews contributed from New York.

Ironically, Guzman's re-arrest in 2016 — after two dramatic prison escapes — has created such a bloody power struggle for his Sinaloa cartel in Mexico that the series' producers thought it would be safer to film in Colombia, the country that used to be the epicenter of the hemisphere's drug violence. Guzman was extradited to the United States in January, and his lawyers complain the conditions he faces at a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial are so restrictive they violate his rights. The filming in Colombia was so cloaked in secrecy that the crew told locals they were filming a mythical TV soap opera, \"Dolores de Amor,\" roughly \"The Pains of Love.\" The Associated Press attended one filming session in the town of Taibo, where a half-dozen extras said they didn't know what the series was about. Its real title is fairly self-explanatory: \"El Chapo.\" At the time filming started, Guzman was still in Mexico and the series' location was shifted for security reasons, said producer Daniel Posada. \"Colombia was a good option, because we have well-trained crews and it is very similar in appearance to Mexico.\" Taibo has a colonial town square, church and park that look like they could be found in rural Mexico. The effect will be completed in post-production by adjusting the intensity of the light to match Mexican skies. Colombia may also be a little less legally complicated. Guzman employed a cadre of lawyers to file a seemingly endless array of legal appeals in Mexico. One of the lawyers, Jose Refugio Rodriguez, suggested the producers could suffer legal consequences for using Guzman's name and story without his permission. \"If they are producing something that he (Guzman) has not authorized, if they start attacking him, or publishing things from his private life, then clearly there will be a legal response,\" Rodriguez said. When Netflix and Univision announced the series last year, they said it is \"based on the life story of one of the world's most notorious criminals.\" Another Guzman lawyer, Andres Granados, told The Associated Press at the time that the two networks would have to pay for the right to use Guzman's name and nickname, which can be translated as \"Shorty.\" \"If they air this, they are immediately going to be sued,\" Granados said. \"They, by necessity, need the authorization of Mr. Guzman, because he is not dead.\" Guzman earlier gave rights to his life story to Mexican actress Kate del Castillo, who arranged a secret 2015 meeting with the then-fugitive drug boss and actor Sean Penn. Del Castillo hasn't said what she would do with those rights. Posada, the producer, said he hasn't received any threats. The series is scheduled to have its U.S. premiere on Univision April 23, and a couple of months later will have a worldwide release on Netflix. Marco de la O, the 38-year-old Mexican stage actor who plays Guzman, bears an extraordinary resemblance to the drug lord after coming out of a makeup session. Speaking before a pursuit scene that included gunfire and screeching tires, De la O said: \"It was a challenge to play Chapo, because of his complexity.\" Guzman, the son of impoverished farmers, rose to a spot on the list of the world's richest people. Asked if he plays Guzman as a hero or a villain, De la O said \"I can't judge him. From an actor's perspective, you don't judge whether the characters are good or bad ... We tell the truth, and that truth can be harsh.\" Research for the script started three years ago, based on meetings with reporters who covered the drug trade, acquaintances, DEA reports and psychological profiles of Guzman drawn up in prison. \"I have never known of a drug trafficker who has had such a long career, and from each stage of his life there are accounts that have allowed us to construct a portrait of his personality and psychological characteristics,\" said Gerardo Reyes, the Univision research director who served as an adviser on the show. The final script turned out to be a mix of reality and fiction. \"It's normal; some things we agreed on, some things we didn't,\" said Reyes. \"We have avoided the Robin Hood image that many have wanted to project on him\" Reyes said. \"He came from a poor background and was obsessed with not returning to it, and this obsession was also extremely violent.\" But the story is not just about Guzman's obsession; it's also about the government corruption in Mexico that allowed him to flourish. \"The series examines the situation in which two types of ambition can coexist and intertwine,\" said Humberto Busto an actor who plays the corrupt politician Don Sol in the series. \"It leads the two characters (Don Sol and Chapo) to the same question: 'For what?'\" \"If in the end all of us wind up in a grave and we're not going to take anything with us, what are we doing all this for?\" ___ AP Writer Maria Verza in Mexico contributed to this report.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/848e784209df4562b86759e5caa3783c/mexican-drug-lord-gets-his-own-miniseries-made-colombia","output":"Title:\nUnfettered online hate speech fuels Islamophobia in China\nDescription:\nHEFEI, China (AP) — The flood of angry anti-Muslim rhetoric on social media was the first sign of how fiercely the suburban middle-class homeowners in this central China city opposed a planned mosque in their neighborhood. It quickly escalated into something more sinister. Soon a pig's head was buried in the ground at the future Nangang mosque, the culmination of a rally in which dozens of residents hoisted banners and circled the planned building site. Then the mosque's imam received a text message carrying a death threat: \"In case someone in your family dies, I have a coffin for you — and more than one, if necessary.\" \"How did things get stirred up to this point?\" the imam, Tao Yingsheng, said in a recent interview. \"Who had even heard of the Nangang mosque before?\" On the dusty plains of the Chinese heartland, a bitter fight over a mosque exemplifies how a surge in anti-Muslim sentiment online is spreading into communities across China, exacerbating simmering ethnic and religious tensions that have in the past erupted in bloodshed. It's also posing a dilemma for the ruling Communist Party, which has allowed Islamophobia to fester online for years as part of its campaign to justify security crackdowns in its restive region of Xinjiang. \"It's let the genie out of the bottle,\" said James Leibold, a professor at La Trobe University in Australia who has tracked the growth of anti-Muslim hate speech on China's internet. Interviews with residents and an examination of social media show how a few disparate online complaints by local homeowners evolved into a concerted campaign to spread hate. Key to it was an unexpected yet influential backer: a Chinese propaganda official, 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles) away in Xinjiang, whose inflammatory social media posts helped draw people into the streets on New Year's Day, resulting in a police crackdown. ___ A stone inscription outside its gate shows the original Nangang mosque was established in the 1780s by members of the Hui minority, the descendants of Silk Road traders who settled across China centuries ago. In its present form, the mosque has served the area's 4,500 Hui for decades, its domed silhouette partially hidden by overgrown shrubs in the countryside beyond Hefei's last paved boulevards. Over the past 10 years urbanization has come to Hefei, with sprawling development reconfiguring the landscape and its demographic flavor, and Hui leaders had been pushing for years to relocate their mosque to a more convenient urban location. City planners in November finally selected a site adjacent to the newly built Hangkong New City condominiums, with its $200,000 two-bedroom units, faux-Mediterranean stylings and a Volvo dealership across the street. The project's homeowners overwhelmingly members of China's ethnic Han majority began complaining on China's popular microblog, Weibo. Some complained the mosque would occupy space promised for a park. Others warned that safety in the area would be compromised. Others were more blunt: Han residents were uncomfortable that a center for Hui community life would be less than 100 meters (300 feet) from their building, a homeowner who later identified himself in messages to the AP by his surname, Cheng, wrote in a petition posted in December. \"And the less said about what happens on Eid al-Adha, the better,\" Cheng wrote, referring to the Islamic holiday in which animals are slaughtered for a sacrificial feast. \"It's absolutely shocking.\" The story soon caught the attention of Cui Zijian, a boyish-looking propaganda official in Xinjiang who writes about the threat of religious extremism on his Weibo account with nearly 30,000 followers. On Dec. 16, Cui suggested homeowners lobby local officials to block the construction, adding: \"If that doesn't work, then how about pig head, pig blood.\" Cui followed that a few hours later with another post repeating the four Chinese characters for pig blood and pig head over and over, attracting hundreds of reposts. While Cui was criticized by some on Weibo, a larger number — including at least one other government propaganda official — took his post as their cue to hurl abuse at the Hui. ___ The mosque dispute was just the latest flashpoint for an increasingly active anti-Muslim social media movement in China. A video of a Hui girl reciting the Quran in Arabic sparked outrage last May over so-called terrorist infiltration of Chinese schools, prompting officials to announce a \"strict ban\" on religion on campuses. Online activists derailed a Hui official's effort to regulate the halal food industry, arguing that religion was creeping into the officially atheistic Chinese state. Han Chinese, who make up 95 percent of the population, have long grumbled about the dozens of China's officially recognized minority groups receiving advantages on the hyper-competitive college entrance exams or exemptions from family-size limits, but online abuse has increasingly targeted Muslims. The rise in Islamophobia comes as Chinese have been buffeted by news of militant attacks in Europe, while at home, violence in Xinjiang and elsewhere has been blamed on Muslim separatists. Beijing has responded to the bloody, years-long insurgency from Muslim Uighur minorities in Xinjiang with further restrictions on Islamic expression, a move rights groups warn could potentially radicalize moderate Muslims. Such policies have also drawn vows of retaliation from the Islamic State and al-Qaeda. Ethnic hostility can only deepen, scholars say, when the government stops discussion of the plight of Muslims or ethnic policies while allowing anti-Muslim rhetoric and hate speech to go unchecked. In 2014, Uighur scholar Ilham Tohti, who had founded a website to host debates about ethnic tensions in Xinjiang, was sentenced to life in prison on separatism charges. Government censors go after descriptions of abuses against Muslims, but \"it doesn't take long whatsoever to find incredibly Islamophobic things that seem to be not censored at all,\" said William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International, which has appealed for Tohti's release. Political observers say the recent rise of a faction within the Communist Party advocating for a hard-line approach on religious affairs has coincided with the rise of government-linked commentators who openly warn about the danger of Islam. \"Interest groups have actively promoted Islamophobia in interior regions in order to create a nationwide environment that justifies Xinjiang's anti-terrorism campaign,\" said Ma Haiyun, a history professor specializing in China's Muslims at Frostburg State University in Maryland. \"There's an Islamophobic movement that aims at creating chaos and even conflicts at the local level.\" After briefly moderating his remarks about the Nangang mosque, the propaganda official, Cui, renewed his criticism in February with an essay arguing that his professional and patriotic duty was to resist extremism. His online speech about Muslims was part of the job, he said. \"For that, we're labeled Muslim-smearers,\" wrote Cui, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment. \"But it is those who instigate a fear of Islam, precisely the terrorists and the extremists, who are the ones smearing Muslims.\" Reached in March, an official at the propaganda department where he worked refused to comment on Cui's involvement in the controversy. But Cui now appears to be even better positioned to influence discourse: The official said Cui was transferred in February to work in the cyberspace administration, the agency in charge of censoring online speech. ___ Tao, the 50-year old imam, recalled the day in December when he heard his mosque was suddenly the subject of thousands of posts and hundreds of comments on Weibo, a service he barely used. He soon found himself soothing local Hui who approached him, shaken by what they were seeing online. \"They said people were planning to hang a pig's head outside our mosque. I said, 'Then we'll remove it.' They said people will bury a pig's head in the ground. I said 'Why can't we just dig it up?'\" Tao said. After protesters followed through with the threat at the New Year's Day demonstration, police detained two protest leaders for two weeks and summoned others for questioning, according to residents. Since then Han indignation has gave way to quiet seething. \"People have been scared into silence,\" said Cheng, the Han tea seller. During a recent visit to Hangkong New City, homeowners repeated the government's mantra that ethnic unity was important, but complained that officials sacrificed their interests to appease a minority. \"If 99 percent of our compound is Han, it doesn't seem appropriate that they put a mosque next door,\" said a middle-aged woman who said her surname was Han. Ma Jianhua, a Nangang district planning official, told the AP that construction will proceed after his office \"appropriately handled\" homeowners' petitions, but declined to elaborate. The mosque dispute has left the city's Hui community on the defensive, with many eager to emphasize their desire to peacefully coexist with their Han neighbors as well as their confidence in the government's handling of the situation. At a ranch past the undulating rapeseed field that separates the condos from rubble-strewn Huimin Lu — Hui People's Road — workers at what is one of the few Hui businesses that hasn't been demolished to make way for high-rises expressed surprise about the mosque dispute, given the area's history of ethnic mingling. \"We've been in these parts a long time,\" a worker surnamed Tao, who is not related to the imam, said as he loaded sacks of dried fatty beef. \"We mind our business and they mind theirs. We don't stir up trouble and they don't either.\" But Tao, the imam, seemed to acknowledge a hardening of attitudes toward Muslims in recent years. \"It may be that the situation has grown more sensitive in that place that we all know about,\" he said after a pause, referring to but not daring to mention Xinjiang. Still he tries to not harbor resentment toward the Han protesters. \"I don't blame the locals because I believe they were influenced,\" he said, sitting below framed pictures of him greeting government religious affairs officials. \"I want them to know Muslims are virtuous people. We are peaceful. We are reasonable. We are tolerant. And we are good Chinese.\"\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/e3711d789c8d48589b77f6e269d424fa/unfettered-online-hate-speech-fuels-islamophobia-china\n\n\n\nTitle:\nTrump advisers: US seeks to fight IS and oust Syria&#039;s Assad\nDescription:\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's national security adviser on Sunday left open the possibility of additional U.S. military action against Syria following last week's missile strike but indicated that the United States was not seeking to act unilaterally to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad. In his first televised interview, H.R. McMaster pointed to dual U.S. goals of defeating the Islamic State group and removing Assad. But he suggested that Trump was seeking a global political response for regime change from U.S. allies as well as Russia, which he said needed to re-evaluate its support of Syria. \"It's very difficult to understand how a political solution could result from the continuation of the Assad regime,\" McMaster said. \"Now, we are not saying that we are the ones who are going to effect that change. What we are saying is, other countries have to ask themselves some hard questions. Russia should ask themselves ...Why are we supporting this murderous regime that is committing mass murder of its own population?\" After last Tuesday's chemical attack in Syria, Trump said his attitude toward Assad \"has changed very much\" and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said \"steps are underway\" to organize a coalition to remove him from power. But as lawmakers called on Trump to consult with Congress on any future military strikes and a longer-term strategy on Syria, Trump administration officials sent mixed signals on the scope of U.S. involvement. While Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, described regime change in Syria as a U.S. priority and inevitable, Tillerson suggested that last week's American airstrikes in retaliation for the chemical attack hadn't really changed U.S. priorities toward ousting Assad. Pressed to clarify, McMaster said the goals of fighting IS and ousting Syria's president were somewhat \"simultaneous\" and that the objective of the missile strike was to send a \"strong political message to Assad.\" He did not rule out additional strikes if Assad continued to engage in atrocities against rebel forces with either chemical or conventional weapons. \"We are prepared to do more,\" he said. \"The president will make whatever decision he thinks is in the best interest of the American people.\" Reluctant to put significant troops on the ground in Syria, the U.S. for years has struggled to prevent Assad from strengthening his hold on power. U.S.-backed rebels groups have long pleaded for more U.S. intervention and complained that Washington has only fought the Islamic State group. So Trump's decision to launch the strikes — which President Barack Obama declined to do after a 2013 chemical attack — has raised optimism among rebels that Trump will more directly confront Assad. Several lawmakers said Sunday that decision shouldn't entirely be up to Trump. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the no. 2 Republican in the Senate, praised Trump's initial missile strike for sending a message to Assad, Russia, Iran and North Korea that \"there's a new administration in charge.\" But he said Trump now needed to work with Congress to set a future course. \"Congress needs to work with the president to try and deal with this long-term strategy, lack of strategy, really, in Syria,\" he said. \"We haven't had one for six years during the Obama administration, and 400,000 civilians have died and millions of people have been displaced internally and externally in Europe and elsewhere.\" Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, agreed. \"What we saw was a reaction to the use of chemical weapons, something I think many of us supported,\" he said. \"But what we did not see is a coherent policy on how we're going to deal with the civil war and also deal with ISIS.\" Still, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he believed that Trump didn't need to consult with Congress. \"I think the president has authorization to use force,\" he said. \"Assad signed the chemical weapons treaty ban. There's an agreement with him not to use chemical weapons.\" Their comments came as Tillerson was making the Trump administration's first official trip this week to Russia, a staunch Assad ally. In interviews broadcast Sunday, Tillerson said defeating the Islamic State group remains the top focus. Once that threat \"has been reduced or eliminated, I think we can turn our attention directly to stabilizing the situation in Syria,\" he said. \"We're hopeful that we can prevent a continuation of the civil war and that we can bring the parties to the table to begin the process of political discussions\" between the Assad government and various rebel groups. The hope, he said, is that \"we can navigate a political outcome in which the Syrian people, in fact, will determine Bashar al-Assad's fate and his legitimacy.\" Haley said \"getting Assad out is not the only priority\" and that countering Iran's influence in Syria was another. Still, Haley said the U.S. didn't see a peaceful future Syria with Assad in power. McMaster, Cornyn and Cardin spoke on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Tillerson appeared on ABC's \"This Week\" and CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Haley and Graham were on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and Haley also appeared on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" ___ Associated Press writer Josh Lederman contributed to this report.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/6d9da3ee01df44829a7878bad18998c2/trump-officials-say-no-new-us-focus-ousting-syrias-assad\n\n\n\nTitle:\nSuicide bombers kill 44 at Palm Sunday services in Egypt\nDescription:\nTANTA, Egypt (AP) — Suicide bombers struck hours apart at two Coptic churches in northern Egypt, killing 44 people and turning Palm Sunday services into scenes of horror and outrage at the government that led the president to call for a three-month state of emergency. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the violence, adding to fears that extremists are shifting their focus to civilians, especially Egypt's Christian minority. The attacks in the northern cities of Tanta and Alexandria that also left 126 people wounded came at the start of Holy Week leading up to Easter, and just weeks before Pope Francis is due to visit. Pope Tawadros II, the leader of the Coptic church who will meet with Francis on April 28-29, was in the Alexandra cathedral at the time of the bombing but was unhurt, the Interior Ministry said. It was the single deadliest day for Christians in decades and the worst since a bombing at a Cairo church in December killed 30 people. Late Sunday night, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi called for a three-month state of emergency. According to Egypt's constitution, parliament must vote in favor of such a declaration — a virtual certainty since it is packed with supporters of the president. It cannot exceed six months without a referendum to extend it. The army chief-turned-president also dispatched elite troops across the country to protect key installations and accused unidentified countries of fueling instability, saying that \"Egyptians have foiled plots and efforts by countries and fascist, terrorist organizations that tried to control Egypt.\" The attacks highlighted the difficulties facing el-Sissi's government in protecting Christians, who make up about 10 percent of Egypt's population. \"Where is the government?\" screamed an angry Maged Saleh, who rushed to the church in the Nile Delta city of Tanta where his mother escaped the carnage. \"There is no government!\" The first bomb exploded inside St. George's Church in Tanta, killing at least 27 people and wounding 78, officials said, overturning pews, shattering windows and staining the whitewashed walls with blood. Video from inside the church broadcast by CBC TV showed people gathered around what appeared to be lifeless, bloody bodies covered with papers. Several doors had been blown off. Women wailed outside. \"After the explosion, everything became dark from the smoke,\" said Edmond Edward, attending Mass with his brother, Emil, who suffered head wounds and leaned on him for support at a nearby hospital. \"There was a clear lapse in security, which must be tightened from now on to save lives,\" he told The Associated Press. The blast appeared to be centered near the altar, he said. Susan Mikhail, whose apartment balcony across the street has a clear view of the church and its front yard, said the explosion violently shook her building. \"Deacons were the first to run out of the church. Many of them had blood on their white robes,\" she told the AP. The more seriously wounded then were carried out by other survivors and taken to hospitals in private cars, she said. Hundreds of residents gathered in the area, and church members blocked people from entering the church as police cordoned off the area. A few hours later, a suicide bomber rushed toward St. Mark's Cathedral in the coastal city of Alexandria, the historic seat of Christendom in Egypt, killing at least 17 people and wounding 48. CCTV images showed a man with a blue sweater tied over his shoulders approaching the main gate to St. Mark's and then being turned away by security and directed toward a metal detector. He passed a female police officer talking to another woman, and entered a metal detector before an explosion engulfed the area. The Health Ministry said six Muslims were among the dead in Alexandria. Pope Tawadros II had held Palm Sunday services at the cathedral and the timing of the attack indicated the bomber had sought to assassinate him. Pope Francis marked Palm Sunday in St. Peter's Square by expressing \"deep condolences to my brother, Pope Tawadros II, the Coptic church and all of the dear Egyptian nation.\" Magdy George Youssef, a deacon at St. George's, said the church was almost full when the blast occurred and threw him under a pew. \"All I could think of was to find my wife, and all I could see was smoke, blood and completely charred bodies,\" the distraught 58-year-old said. Youssef, who suffered only an injured ear, later found his wife at home, with burns to her face. IS said in a statement that two Egyptian suicide bombers named Abu Ishaq al Masri and Abu al Baraa al Masri carried out the church attacks and vowed to continue attacks against Christians. \"What happened is a dangerous indicator that shows how easy it is to attack a large gathering of people in different places,\" said researcher Ishaq Ibrahim with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. \"There is a complete government failure in taking the IS threat seriously.\" El-Sissi said in a statement that Sunday's attacks would only strengthen the resolve of Egyptians against \"evil forces.\" He held an emergency meeting of the National Defense Council, which includes the prime minister, the defense and interior ministers, the speaker of parliament and top army commanders and security chiefs. Regional police chief Brig. Gen. Hossam Elddin Khalifa was fired over the Tanta bombing, with Maj. Gen. Tarek Hassouna replacing him, state-run newspaper al-Ahram reported. President Donald Trump tweeted that he is \"so sad to hear of the terrorist attack\" against the U.S. ally but added that he has \"great confidence\" that el-Sissi \"will handle the situation properly.\" The two leaders met at the White House on April 3. Grand Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, head of Egypt's Al-Azhar — the leading center of learning in Sunni Islam — also condemned the attacks, calling them a \"despicable terrorist bombing that targeted the lives of innocents.\" Both Israel and the Islamic Hamas movement ruling neighboring Gaza condemned the bombings as well. An Islamic State affiliate claimed the December bombing as well as a string of killings in the northern Sinai that forced hundreds of Christians to flee to safer areas. The militants recently vowed to step up attacks against Christians, whom they regard as infidels. Egypt has struggled to combat a wave of Islamic militancy since the 2013 military overthrow of an elected Islamist president. The Sinai-based IS affiliate has mainly attacked police and soldiers, but has also claimed bombings including the downing of a Russian passenger jetliner in the Sinai in 2015, which killed all 224 people aboard and devastated Egypt's tourism industry. Egypt's Copts are one of the oldest Christian communities in the Middle East and have long complained of discrimination and that the government does not do enough to protect them. Security at churches is routinely increased around religious holidays. The Copts largely supported the military overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, and incurred the wrath of many of his followers, who attacked churches and other Christian institutions. While the Copts have stood steadfast alongside the government, an increase in attacks on Christians has tested that support. Egyptian media had previously reported that the church in Tanta had been targeted before, with a bomb defused there in late March. As night fell, hundreds of Christians, mostly clad in black, streamed to the church to offer their condolences. Scuffles broke out between the mourners and church volunteers guarding the church's doors as many pushed and shoved to get in. ___ Associated Press writers Maggie Michael, Brian Rohan, Menna Zaki and Maamoun Youssef in Cairo and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed to this report.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/88b8fef3a96e433c902a303cd5db928e/egypt-state-media-bombing-church-nile-delta\n\n\n\nTitle:\nTillerson&#039;s Russia trip highlights emergence from shadows\nDescription:\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Criticized for his low-profile diplomacy, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is emerging from the shadows with a leading public role in shaping and explaining the Trump administration's missile strikes in Syria. And, he's set for an even higher-profile mission, heading to Moscow under the twin clouds of Russia's U.S. election meddling and its possible support for a Syrian chemical weapons attack. Since taking office in February, the former Exxon Mobil CEO has admittedly shunned the spotlight and the press. Yet, Tillerson was surprisingly visible during last week's announcement of the response to the gruesome chemical attack, fielding questions from reporters on and off camera, and then captured in an official White House photo seated next to President Donald Trump as they heard the result of the 59 cruise missiles that struck a Syrian military base. Tillerson was a prominent fixture during the most important foreign policy period in Trump's young presidency: a two-day summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping that coincided with the strikes against Syria. He was by Trump's side during his meetings with Xi and spoke publicly multiple times to address both issues. It was Tillerson who delivered the Trump administration's first blistering condemnation of Russia in the hours after the strikes. Standing in a cramped conference room alongside national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Tillerson said Moscow had \"failed\" to live up to its obligations under a 2013 agreement to strip Syria of its chemical weapons stockpiles. \"Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has simply been incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement,\" he said. On Sunday, he made his first network television interview appearances. In one interview, Tillerson said he sees no reason for retaliation from Russia for the U.S. missile strikes. Russia maintains a close political and military alliance with President Bashar Assad's government and has been accused of supporting its attacks against Syrians opposed to Assad's rule — something Moscow adamantly denies. Tillerson said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that Russians were not targeted by the strikes. He also said the top U.S. priority in the region hadn't changed and remained the defeat of Islamic State militants. Then he headed to Europe to gather with the foreign ministers of the other major industrialized nations before venturing on eastward to become the first Trump Cabinet member to visit Moscow — and possibly meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The criticism from the foreign policy establishment's left and right that has dogged Tillerson's tenure is dying down. Tillerson had faced questions about whether he understood that his new position meant he was now the face of the United States to the world, that he had to answer no longer to a small group of top shareholders but to more than 320 million Americans. The secretary of state must be \"the spokesman for American foreign policy,\" said Eliot Cohen, a senior State Department official during George W. Bush's presidency. \"This is the administration's first crisis but it won't be their last by a long shot, so he's going to have to get used to this.\" Joining Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, Tillerson was supposed to focus on the informal summit with Xi. Instead, he was thrust to the forefront after photos of the bodies piled in heaps in Idlib, Syria, dramatically altered the agenda. Only a week earlier, Tillerson had alarmed U.S. allies by indicating the U.S. was no longer interested in pushing for Assad's removal from power. In the hours leading up to Trump's decision to order the strikes, Tillerson was among the most forward-leaning of Trump's top aides in suggesting the U.S. would deliver an \"appropriate response.\" He challenged Russia publicly in a way Trump appeared scrupulously to avoid and said of Assad early Thursday: \"It would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people.\" After the cruise missiles crashed down in Syria, Tillerson was calm and commanding in a question-and-answer session with journalists. Cohen, a conservative critic of Trump's foreign policy who has chided Tillerson for his reticence, said he saw Tillerson growing into the job. \"I suspect you'll see more of him as he grows more comfortable in dealing with the press and in his relationship with the president and the administration's national security team,\" Cohen said. The challenge will be greater in Russia's capital this week. Tillerson is arriving at a fragile point in U.S.-Russia relations, where he will have to confront the Kremlin's anger over the missile strikes in Syria along with suspicion at home that Moscow may have been complicit in the Syrian government's chemical weapons attack. Senior U.S. military officials have said they are looking into whether Russia provided drone surveillance and helped Syrian forces try to cover up what they'd done. \"I think that there will be a lot of answers that come out of that meeting. And I think that's when the president will make his decisions,\" said Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, during an appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Beyond Syria are disputes over Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. At the same time, Tillerson carries to Moscow the weight of FBI and congressional investigations into Russia's interference in last year's presidential election. The Trump campaign's possible ties to the presumed Russian meddlers are also under scrutiny. \"This is going to be Tillerson's biggest test to date,\" said Julianne Smith, a National Security Council and Defense Department official under President Barack Obama. When he goes to Russia, keeping a low profile would likely be impossible, even if it were his goal. ___ Associated Press writers Josh Lederman and Julie Pace contributed to this report.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/1e8bda8a75104d02b4606c5c397af8bc/tillerson-steps-syria-russia-after-avoiding-spotlight\n\n\n\nTitle:\nNew report gives US airlines better grades across the board\nDescription:\nDALLAS (AP) — The airlines are getting better at sticking to their schedules and are losing fewer bags. Their customers seem to be complaining less often. Those are the findings of an annual report on airline quality being released Monday by researchers at Wichita State University and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The researchers use information compiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation to rate the airlines for on-time performance, baggage handling, bumping passengers off oversold flights, and complaints filed with the government. They planned to release their list of the best airlines later Monday. The report's general observations: — ON TIME PERFORMANCE: The percentage of flights that arrived on time or close enough rose to 81.4 percent in 2016 from 79.9 percent in 2015. Of 12 leading U.S. carriers, only American, JetBlue and Virgin America got worse. — LOST BAGS: The rate of bags being lost, stolen or delayed fell 17 percent. — BUMPING PASSENGERS: Your chances of getting bumped by the airline dropped 18 percent, which doesn't include people who voluntarily gave up their seat for money or a travel voucher. — FEWER COMPLAINTS: The rate of complaints filed with the government dropped about one-fifth, with complaints rising only for Hawaiian and Virgin America. The official complaint rates don't include the larger number of complaints that passengers file directly with the airline. The airlines are not required to report those figures. Clearly, however, airlines still have a perception problem. It's not hard to find passengers who complain about a miserable flight, a missed connection, or shabby treatment by airline employees. Comments like that abound on Twitter. \"People don't look at the numbers,\" said Dean Headley, a marketing professor at Wichita State and co-author of Monday's report. \"They just know what happened to them, or they hear what happened to other people.\" The Wichita State and Embry-Riddle researchers have been doing their report for more than 25 years, making it useful for comparing airlines. But some observers of the airline industry dismiss their number-crunching approach, and there are many other surveys that purport to rank the airlines. The Transportation Department counts a flight as being on time even if it arrives up to 14 minutes late. \"Airlines are happy with that (grace period) because it makes them look better and misleads the passenger,\" said aviation consultant Michael Baiada. He said airlines can do better, and besides, travelers pay to be on time — not 14 minutes late. More broadly, a statistical analysis of government data \"really doesn't take into consideration how the customer is treated,\" said Bryan Saltzburg, an executive with travel site TripAdvisor LLC. \"How comfortable are they on the plane? How helpful is the staff? What's the value for what the customer paid?\" TripAdvisor released its own airline rankings Monday, which it said were based on analysis of \"hundreds of thousands\" of reviews posted by users. It placed JetBlue and Alaska Airlines among the top 10 in the world, and it rated Delta ahead of American and United among the largest U.S. carriers. Other outfits including J.D. Power and Skytrax also put out ratings. Airlines boast when they win. Recently, American Airlines started putting stickers on all 968 of its planes to note that a trade publication, Air Transport World, named it airline of the year. ___ David Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/0c8396e963e14be69be4951d08cfb84e/new-report-gives-us-airlines-better-grades-across-board\n\n\n\nTitle:\nFord says hybrid police car catches bad guys, saves gas too\nDescription:\nDEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — The next time the cops chase you down for speeding, they could be driving a fuel-efficient gas-electric hybrid. Ford Motor Co., which sells more police cars in the U.S. than any other automaker, says it will offer a police pursuit version of the hybrid Fusion midsize sedan, in response to requests from cities nationwide. The new car, with its 2-Liter four-cylinder engine and 1.4 kilowatt lithium-ion battery, is expected to get 38 miles per gallon of gas in combined city-highway driving. That's 20 mpg more than Ford's current police car, the Taurus police interceptor. The hybrids won't be as fast as the Taurus with a 3.7-Liter turbocharged V6, but Ford expects it to be quick enough to earn a pursuit rating when tested later this year by the Michigan State Police and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the first hybrid to earn that honor. To get a pursuit rating, cars have to perform well in acceleration, handling, braking, top speed and ergonomics and make the list of cars that the Michigan and Los Angeles agencies would buy. When the throttle is held down for five seconds, the car will go into pursuit mode, using both the electric motor and the gas engine for maximum performance, Ford said. The company also says the car will be durable for tough police duties. Police cars spend much of their days idling by the side of a road, and that's where the hybrid has a true advantage, Ford said. The gas engine will shut off at idle with the battery handling the electrical load for flashers, radios and other items. It will restart to recharge the battery. Ford said at $2.50 per gallon for gas, the hybrid would save a police department $3,877 per year in fuel costs per vehicle. The price of the hybrid, available in the fall of 2018, isn't being released just yet. Ford was to unveil the police car Monday with press conferences in New York and Los Angeles. One already has been outfitted to look like a Los Angeles police cruiser. While big-city departments might be most interested in the fuel savings, the cars might also be appealing to small departments. Thomas Korabik, chief of the 10-officer North Muskegon, Michigan, Police Department, said his city spends about $22,000 per year on gasoline for four cruisers and would be interested in cutting that in half. But he wonders if the Fusion is big enough inside to carry computers, radios and other equipment. Many departments have switched to SUVs to handle the equipment, said Korabik, who also is president of the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police. \"Anytime you can save money it is good,\" he said. \"I'd want to see the car first and see how it would hold up.\" Todd Soderquist, Ford's chief engineer for the Fusion Police Responder, conceded the car is smaller than other cruisers on the outside. \"Internally, you'll be surprised at how comparable they are,\" he said.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/295bbfe0f9f64fbea758e0119311b891/ford-says-hybrid-police-car-catches-bad-guys-saves-gas-too\n\n\n\nTitle:\nHawaii LGBT couples seek equal access to fertility treatment\nDescription:\nHONOLULU (AP) — Sean Smith and his husband paid more than $20,000 for a fertility procedure when they decided to have a child using a surrogate mother. They did not know at the time that if they were a heterosexual couple, they might have saved that money. Now, Smith and other members of Hawaii's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community are lobbying for equal access to the financial help married, heterosexual couples enjoy under state law. They are pushing legislation that would require insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization for more couples, including making Hawaii the first state to require the coverage for surrogates, which would help male same-sex couples who must use a surrogate. \"Now that marriage equality is the law of the land and is accepted, now let's turn to family building, and let's figure out how we fix all these inequities that exist,\" said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of Resolve, a national organization that advocates for access to fertility treatments. Hawaii is one of eight states that require insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization, a costly procedure where a doctor retrieves eggs from a woman, combines them with sperm from a man and then implants an embryo into a woman's uterus. But Hawaii's mandate applies only to married heterosexual couples because it covers the medical intervention only if a woman uses sperm from her spouse, leaving the LGBT community and single women behind. \"At the end of the visit, I would be going into the office and pulling out my credit card, and other people are probably just walking out and insurance is picking up the tab,\" Smith said. \"We had to borrow money, refinance a second mortgage, and I'm sure there are people who don't even explore the option because the expenses are too great.\" The measure pending in the Hawaii Legislature removes requirements that the egg and sperm come from a married couple and includes surrogates among the people to be covered. No other state has included surrogates in their laws, Collura said. \"It is definitely groundbreaking,\" Collura said. \"And it's an often-overlooked way that people choose to build their family, and it should not be left out. It's great to see that Hawaii is taking the lead.\" Kaiser Permanente Hawaii opposed the measure, saying the medical provider and insurer does not perform in vitro fertilization with donor eggs or surrogates because of complex legal issues and medical risks. The company asked lawmakers to remove egg donors and surrogates from the bill, saying requiring coverage of additional procedures would raise costs for the company and its customers. A similar measure in Hawaii failed in previous legislative sessions. But aside from Kaiser, the bill has seen little opposition this year. A broad coalition including the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii, the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission and the Democratic Party of Hawaii are working with LGBT groups to push for change. The proposal passed the state Senate and is up for a vote in the House this week. Maryland had a law that also excluded same-sex couples until about a year ago, when the Legislature changed the provision so it no longer required using a husband's sperm. That helped lesbian couples, but gay men were still left out because the law didn't cover surrogates, Collura said. Most state mandates limit insurance reimbursement to a certain number of in vitro fertilization trials or allow coverage only after years of infertility. Some states also allow religious or small employers to get out of the requirement. \"We need to change these laws,\" Collura said. \"We need to update them and make them so that they are no longer discriminatory.\"\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/9c86d06eab8b49e3818597834d6571f8/hawaii-lgbt-couples-seek-equal-access-fertility-treatment\n\n\n\nTitle:\nNew York derailment highlights US infrastructure concerns\nDescription:\nWhen a train jumped the tracks this past week at New York's Penn Station, the seemingly minor accident led to a cascade of exasperating delays for hundreds of thousands of commuters. When a flood forced authorities to condemn a one-lane, century-old bridge in rural Ozark, Missouri, it was no less frustrating for the residents and business owners cut off from their shortest route into town. The two episodes highlight a reality about the U.S. transportation system — it is aging, congested and so vital that when things go wrong, big and costly disruptions can result for which there is no quick fix. Though President Donald Trump has promised a $1 trillion infrastructure-rebuilding program, not all of that may go toward transportation. Even then, it would fall well short of the many trillions needed to fix the country's web of roads, bridges, railways, subways and bus stations. The commuter train in New York derailed because of a weakened railroad tie. No one was seriously injured. But the incident shut down eight of the station's 21 tracks, disrupting Amtrak service in the Northeast from Boston to Washington, as well as delaying commuter trains in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for the better part of a week. Business meetings were canceled, ballgames, dinners and doctor's appointments missed, and commuters fumed. Lawyer Dominic Boone, who travels into New York from New Jersey, complained that because he arrived late to the office and had to leave early to catch a different train, he lost 10 hours of work for which he could have billed clients. \"They should have been working on Penn Station forever ago,\" Boone said. \"As a nation, we should be spending more on our crumbling infrastructure.\" The disruption was only a brief example of the frustration travelers could face if the region can't find a way to replace a pair of deteriorating, overcrowded, century-old rail tunnels that run under the Hudson River and connect New York and New Jersey. The tunnels, which were severely damaged in Superstorm Sandy in 2012, could cost more than $20 billion to replace. But the money has yet to be lined up. And construction, whenever it begins, may take more than a decade. The Penn Station derailment came less than two weeks after another one there, caused by a misaligned track. And it happened just days after motorists in Atlanta were forced to begin taking long, bumper-to-bumper detours because a fire collapsed an Interstate 85 overpass linking the city to some of its biggest suburbs. Arson — not aging steel and concrete — is suspected there. It could take until mid-June to repair the highway. Earlier this year, a cracked steel beam forced the closing of a major bridge between Pennsylvania and New Jersey for 1½ months. Improving the nation's roads and bridges would require $120 billion a year through 2020, according to a recent U.S. Department of Transportation estimate. But annual spending at all levels of government is just $88 billion. And the nation's mass transit systems have over a $90 billion backlog of maintenance and repair needs. The capacity of the nation's transportation system is lagging behind population growth, leading to ever greater congestion. By 2040, nearly 30,000 miles of the nation's busiest highways are expected to be clogged on a daily basis. Rural communities also face challenges, partly because they have fewer residents over whom to spread the cost of transportation improvements. Grant County, Oklahoma, for example, has more than 3,500 bridges with a population of about 4,500 and an economy based on agriculture and energy production. \"While this infrastructure was ideal 70 years ago for transporting livestock and crops, it is inadequate to support today's heavier trucks, increased traffic and higher operating needs,\" county commission chairwoman Cindy Bobbitt told U.S. senators at a recent hearing. The complexities of government can sometimes slow down improvements, as cities, counties, states, port authorities, special taxing districts and federal agencies all have a say in which projects get built, when to do the work and how to pay the bills. Plans for wider roads and new rail lines can also face opposition from the communities they pass through because of concerns about noise, pollution and diminished property values. \"Of course I believe there needs to be more\" infrastructure investment, said Martin Wachs, a retired professor of civil and environmental engineering and urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"At the same time, political decisions have to be made that weigh that against investments in education and health care and so forth.\" At least 20 states have raised taxes or fees for transportation over the past five years. California became the latest to do so Thursday, as legislators passed a bill to raise $5 billion annually through higher fuel taxes and vehicle fees to pay for road and bridge repairs, public transit and pedestrian trails. The plan tackles part of a $137 billion backlog of deferred maintenance on state highways and local roads. It came together after a destructive winter in which flooding caused nearly $600 million in damage to highways. Indiana and Tennessee are among other states considering raising fuel taxes and fees for transportation this year. In Ozark, a town of fewer than 20,000 people in Missouri, voters approved a transportation sales tax Tuesday of three-eighths of a cent, with some of the proceeds going toward a new, $3 million two-lane bridge to replace the narrow structure that has been closed since it was damaged by flooding in 2015. The bridge closing has forced 75-year-old Gary Jenks to drive an extra 10 minutes along a circuitous route every time he needs to go the doctor or pharmacy or visit his family on the opposite side of town. \"It's just been a total inconvenience and a burden,\" Jenks said. ___ Associated Press reporter Karen Matthews contributed from New York.

Ironically, Guzman's re-arrest in 2016 — after two dramatic prison escapes — has created such a bloody power struggle for his Sinaloa cartel in Mexico that the series' producers thought it would be safer to film in Colombia, the country that used to be the epicenter of the hemisphere's drug violence. Guzman was extradited to the United States in January, and his lawyers complain the conditions he faces at a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial are so restrictive they violate his rights. The filming in Colombia was so cloaked in secrecy that the crew told locals they were filming a mythical TV soap opera, \"Dolores de Amor,\" roughly \"The Pains of Love.\" The Associated Press attended one filming session in the town of Taibo, where a half-dozen extras said they didn't know what the series was about. Its real title is fairly self-explanatory: \"El Chapo.\" At the time filming started, Guzman was still in Mexico and the series' location was shifted for security reasons, said producer Daniel Posada. \"Colombia was a good option, because we have well-trained crews and it is very similar in appearance to Mexico.\" Taibo has a colonial town square, church and park that look like they could be found in rural Mexico. The effect will be completed in post-production by adjusting the intensity of the light to match Mexican skies. Colombia may also be a little less legally complicated. Guzman employed a cadre of lawyers to file a seemingly endless array of legal appeals in Mexico. One of the lawyers, Jose Refugio Rodriguez, suggested the producers could suffer legal consequences for using Guzman's name and story without his permission. \"If they are producing something that he (Guzman) has not authorized, if they start attacking him, or publishing things from his private life, then clearly there will be a legal response,\" Rodriguez said. When Netflix and Univision announced the series last year, they said it is \"based on the life story of one of the world's most notorious criminals.\" Another Guzman lawyer, Andres Granados, told The Associated Press at the time that the two networks would have to pay for the right to use Guzman's name and nickname, which can be translated as \"Shorty.\" \"If they air this, they are immediately going to be sued,\" Granados said. \"They, by necessity, need the authorization of Mr. Guzman, because he is not dead.\" Guzman earlier gave rights to his life story to Mexican actress Kate del Castillo, who arranged a secret 2015 meeting with the then-fugitive drug boss and actor Sean Penn. Del Castillo hasn't said what she would do with those rights. Posada, the producer, said he hasn't received any threats. The series is scheduled to have its U.S. premiere on Univision April 23, and a couple of months later will have a worldwide release on Netflix. Marco de la O, the 38-year-old Mexican stage actor who plays Guzman, bears an extraordinary resemblance to the drug lord after coming out of a makeup session. Speaking before a pursuit scene that included gunfire and screeching tires, De la O said: \"It was a challenge to play Chapo, because of his complexity.\" Guzman, the son of impoverished farmers, rose to a spot on the list of the world's richest people. Asked if he plays Guzman as a hero or a villain, De la O said \"I can't judge him. From an actor's perspective, you don't judge whether the characters are good or bad ... We tell the truth, and that truth can be harsh.\" Research for the script started three years ago, based on meetings with reporters who covered the drug trade, acquaintances, DEA reports and psychological profiles of Guzman drawn up in prison. \"I have never known of a drug trafficker who has had such a long career, and from each stage of his life there are accounts that have allowed us to construct a portrait of his personality and psychological characteristics,\" said Gerardo Reyes, the Univision research director who served as an adviser on the show. The final script turned out to be a mix of reality and fiction. \"It's normal; some things we agreed on, some things we didn't,\" said Reyes. \"We have avoided the Robin Hood image that many have wanted to project on him\" Reyes said. \"He came from a poor background and was obsessed with not returning to it, and this obsession was also extremely violent.\" But the story is not just about Guzman's obsession; it's also about the government corruption in Mexico that allowed him to flourish. \"The series examines the situation in which two types of ambition can coexist and intertwine,\" said Humberto Busto an actor who plays the corrupt politician Don Sol in the series. \"It leads the two characters (Don Sol and Chapo) to the same question: 'For what?'\" \"If in the end all of us wind up in a grave and we're not going to take anything with us, what are we doing all this for?\" ___ AP Writer Maria Verza in Mexico contributed to this report.\nUrl:\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/848e784209df4562b86759e5caa3783c/mexican-drug-lord-gets-his-own-miniseries-made-colombia"}],"timestamp":"2017-04-10T04:56:01.459Z"}

After his return to India in 1915, he set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.

He is the first African American to have served as president, as well as the first born outside the contiguous United States. He previously served in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008, and in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 to 2004.\n\nObama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, two years after the territory was admitted to the Union as the 50th state. He grew up mostly in Hawaii, but also spent one year of his childhood in Washington State and four years in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988 Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduation, he became a civil rights attorney and professor, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004, with his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after his campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain, and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\nDuring his first two years in office, Obama signed many landmark bills. Main reforms were the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often referred to as \"Obamacare\"), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Dont Ask, Dont Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession, but the GOP regained control of the House of Representatives in 2011.

In foreign policy, Obama increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the U.S.-Russian New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi, and the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.\nAfter winning re-election by defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted greater inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama also advocated gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated the sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba.\nObama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.Obama leaving office at 60% approval ratingObama approval hits 60% as end of term approaches He currently resides in Washington, D.C.

In addition, Jobs helped to initiate the development of the visual effects industry when he funded the spinout of the computer graphics division of George Lucass Lucasfilm in 1986.(ref: Pixar Founding Documents)Pixar Founding Documents  The new company, Pixar, would eventually produce the first fully computer-animated film, Toy Story—an event made possible in part because of Jobss financial support.\nIn 1997, Apple merged with NeXT.  Within a few months of the merger, Jobs became CEO of his former company, reviving Apple at the verge of bankruptcy. Beginning in 1997 with the \"Think different\" advertising campaign, Jobs worked closely with designer Jonathan Ive to develop a line of products that would have larger cultural ramifications: the iMac, iTunes and iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. Mac OS was also revamped into OS X (renamed \"macOS\" in 2016), based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform.\nJobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003 and died on October 5, 2011, of respiratory arrest related to the tumor."}],"timestamp":"2017-05-06T04:39:30.877Z"}
